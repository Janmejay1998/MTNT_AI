Hello, TEDWomen, what's up.
Not good enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what is up?
My name is Maysoon Zayid,  and I am not drunk,  but the doctor who delivered me was.
He cut my mom six different times  in six different directions,  suffocating poor little me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy,  which means I shake all the time.
Look.
It's exhausting.
I'm like Shakira, Shakira meets Muhammad Ali.
CP is not genetic.
It's not a birth defect. You can't catch it.
No one put a curse on my mother's uterus,  and I didn't get it because my parents are first cousins,  which they are.
It only happens from accidents,  like what happened to me on my birth day.
Now, I must warn you,  I'm not inspirational.
And I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me,  because at some point in your life,  you have dreamt of being disabled.
Come on a journey with me.
It's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall,  you're driving around in circles looking for parking,  and what do you see?
Sixteen empty handicapped spaces.   And you're like, "God, can't I just be a little disabled?"
Also, I've got to tell you,  I've got 99 problems, and palsy is just one.
If there was an Oppression Olympics,  I would win the gold medal.
I'm Palestinian, Muslim, I'm female, I'm disabled,  and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better about yourself, maybe you should.
Cliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown.
I have always loved the fact  that my hood and my affliction share the same initials.
I also love the fact  that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City, I could.
A lot of people with CP don't walk,  but my parents didn't believe in "can't."
My father's mantra was,  "You can do it, yes you can can."
So, if my three older sisters were mopping,  I was mopping.
If my three older sisters went to public school,  my parents would sue the school system  and guarantee that I went too,  and if we didn't all get A's,  we all got my mother's slipper.
My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old  by placing my heels on his feet  and just walking.
Another tactic that he used  is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it.
My inner stripper was very strong.
No, by the first day of kindergarten,  I was walking like a champ  who had been punched one too many times.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my town,  and they were all my family.
Now there are 20 Arabs in town,  and they are still all my family.   I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian.
This was before 9/11  and before politicians thought it was appropriate  to use "I hate Muslims" as a campaign slogan.
The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith.
They did, however, seem very concerned  that I would starve to death during Ramadan.
I would explain to them that I have enough fat  to live off of for three whole months,  so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake.
I have tap-danced on Broadway.
Yeah, on Broadway. It's crazy.   My parents couldn't afford physical therapy,  so they sent me to dancing school.
I learned how to dance in heels,  which means I can walk in heels.
And I'm from Jersey,  and we are really concerned with being chic,  so if my friends wore heels, so did I.
And when my friends went and spent their summer vacations  on the Jersey Shore, I did not.
I spent my summers in a war zone,  because my parents were afraid  that if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer,  we'd grow up to be Madonna.
Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me,  so I drank deer's milk,  I had hot cups on my back,  I was dunked in the Dead Sea,  and I remember the water burning my eyes  and thinking, "It's working! It's working!"
But one miracle cure we did find was yoga.
I have to tell you, it's very boring,  but before I did yoga,  I was a stand-up comedian who can't stand up.
And now I can stand on my head.
My parents reinforced this notion  that I could do anything,  that no dream was impossible,  and my dream was to be  on the daytime soap opera "General Hospital."
I went to college during affirmative action  and got a sweet scholarship to ASU,  Arizona State University,  because I fit every single quota.   I was like the pet lemur of the theater department.
Everybody loved me.
I did all the less-than-intelligent kids' homework,  I got A's in all of my classes,  A's in all of their classes.
Every time I did a scene from "The Glass Menagerie,"  my professors would weep.
But I never got cast.
Finally, my senior year,  ASU decided to do a show called "They Dance Real Slow in Jackson."
It's a play about a girl with CP.
I was a girl with CP.
So I start shouting from the rooftops,  "I'm finally going to get a part!
I have cerebral palsy!
Free at last! Free at last!
Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!"
I didn't get the part.   Sherry Brown got the part.
I went racing to the head of the theater department  crying hysterically, like someone shot my cat,  to ask her why,  and she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stunts.
I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts,  neither can the character."
This was a part that I was literally born to play  they gave it to a non-palsy actress.
College was imitating life.
Hollywood has a sordid history  of casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen.
Upon graduating, I moved back home,  and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera.
My dream was coming true.
And I knew that I would be promoted  from "Diner Diner" to "Wacky Best Friend" in no time.   But instead, I remained a glorified piece of furniture  that you could only recognize from the back of my head,  and it became clear to me  that casting directors  didn't hire fluffy, ethnic, disabled actors.
They only hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg,  Roseanne Barr, Ellen,  and all of these women had one thing in common:  they were comedians.
So I became a comic.
My first gig was driving famous comics  from New York City to shows in New Jersey,  and I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove  when he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike  with a chick with CP driving him.
I've performed in clubs all over America,  and I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East,  uncensored and uncovered.   Some people say I'm the first stand-up comic in the Arab world.
I never like to claim first,  but I do know that they never heard  that nasty little rumor that women aren't funny,  and they find us hysterical.   In 2003, my brother from another mother and father  Dean Obeidallah and I started  the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival,  now in its 10th year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab-Americans in media,  while also reminding casting directors  that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous.
Mainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier  than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability.
My big break came in 2010.
I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show  "Countdown with Keith Olbermann."
I walked in looking like I was going to the prom,  and they shuffle me into a studio  and seat me on a spinning, rolling chair.
So I looked at the stage manager  and I'm like, "Excuse me, can I have another chair?"
And she looked at me and she went,  "Five, four, three, two ..."
And we were live, right?
So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk  so that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment,  and when the interview was over, I was livid.
I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it,  and I knew I would never get invited back.
But not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back,  he made me a full-time contributor,  and he taped down my chair.
One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann  was that humans on the Internet are scumbags.
People say children are cruel,  but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult.
Suddenly, my disability on the world wide web is fair game.
I would look at clips online and see comments like,  "Yo, why's she tweakin'?"
"Yo, is she retarded?"
And my favorite, "Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist.
What does she suffer from?
We should really pray for her."
One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits:  screenwriter, comedian, palsy.
Disability is as visual as race.
If a wheelchair user can't play Beyoncé,  then Beyoncé can't play a wheelchair user.
The disabled are the largest —  Yeah, clap for that, man. Come on.
People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world,  and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment.
The doctors said that I wouldn't walk,  but I am here in front of you.
However, if I grew up with social media,  I don't think I would be.
I hope that together,  we can create more positive images  of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Perhaps if there were more positive images,  it would foster less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well.
My crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places.
I got to walk the red carpet  flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci  and the iconic Loreen Arbus.
I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler  and work with my idol, the amazing Dave Matthews.
I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild.
I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey  at the 2008 DNC.
And I founded Maysoon's Kids,  a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children  a sliver of the chance my parents gave me.
But the one moment that stands out the most  was when I got -- before this moment --     But the one moment that stands out the most  was when I got to perform  for the man who floats like a butterfly  and stings like a bee,  has Parkinson's and shakes just like me,  Muhammad Ali.
It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live,  and I dedicate this talk to his memory.
My name is Maysoon Zayid,  and if I can can, you can can.
I would like to talk to you about a story  about a small town kid.
I don't know his name, but I do know his story.
He lives in a small village in southern Somalia.
His village is near Mogadishu.
Drought drives the small village into poverty  and to the brink of starvation.
With nothing left for him there,  he leaves for the big city, in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.
When he arrives, there are no opportunities,  no jobs, no way forward.
He ends up living in a tent city  on the outskirts of Mogadishu.
Maybe a year passes, nothing.
One day, he's approached by a gentleman  who offers to take him to lunch,  then to dinner, to breakfast.
He meets this dynamic group of people,  and they give him a break.
He's given a bit of money  to buy himself some new clothes,  money to send back home to his family.
He is introduced to this young woman.
He eventually gets married.
He starts this new life.
He has a purpose in life.
One beautiful day in Mogadishu,  under an azure blue sky,  a car bomb goes off.
That small town kid with the big city dreams  was the suicide bomber,  and that dynamic group of people  were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization  linked to al Qaeda.
So how does the story of a small town kid  just trying to make it big in the city  end up with him blowing himself up?
He was waiting.
He was waiting for an opportunity,  waiting to begin his future,  waiting for a way forward,  and this was the first thing that came along.
This was the first thing that pulled him out  of what we call waithood.
in urban centers around the world.
It is the story of the disenfranchised, unemployed urban youth  who sparks riots in Johannesburg,  sparks riots in London,  who reaches out for something other than waithood.
For young people, the promise of the city,  the big city dream is that of opportunity,  of jobs, of wealth,  but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities.
Often it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates.
By 2030, three out of five people living in cities  will be under the age of 18.
If we do not include young people  if we do not provide them opportunities,  the story of waithood,  the gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs,  will be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, Mogadishu,  70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment.
70 percent don't work,  don't go to school.
They pretty much do nothing.
I went back to Mogadishu last month,  and I went to visit Madina Hospital,  the hospital I was born in.
I remember standing in front of that  bullet-ridden hospital thinking,  what if I had never left?
What if I had been forced into that same state of waithood?
Would I have become a terrorist?
I'm not really sure about the answer.
My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host  a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit.
I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders.
We sat down and brainstormed on solutions  to the biggest challenges facing their city.
One of the young men in the room was Aden.
He went to university in Mogadishu, graduated.
There were no jobs, no opportunities.
I remember him telling me,  because he was a college graduate,  unemployed, frustrated,  that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab  and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.
They sought people like him out.
But his story takes a different route.
In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier  to getting from point A to point B are the roads.
Twenty-three years of civil war  have completely destroyed the road system,  and a motorbike can be the easiest way  to get around.
Aden saw an opportunity and seized it.
He started a motorbike company.
He began renting out motorbikes  to local residents who couldn't normally afford them.
He bought 10 bikes, with the help  of family and friends,  and his dream is to eventually expand  to several hundred within the next three years.
How is this story different?
What makes his story different?
I believe it is his ability to identify  and seize a new opportunity.
It's entrepreneurship,  and I believe entrepreneurship can be  the most powerful tool against waithood.
It empowers young people  to be the creators of the very economic opportunities  they are so desperately seeking.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man  who attended one of my meetings,  Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist.
at the summit in entrepreneurship  and how to be innovative  and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship.
He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen  in over 22 years,  and until recently, until Mohamed came along,  if you wanted flowers at your wedding,  you used plastic bouquets  shipped from abroad.
If you asked someone,  "When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?"
for many who grew up under civil war,  the answer would be, "Never."
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a landscaping and design floral company.
He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu,  and started growing tulips and lilies,  which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate.
And he began delivering flowers to weddings,  creating gardens at homes  and businesses around the city,  and he's now working on creating  Mogadishu's first public park in 22 years.
There's no public park in Mogadishu.
He wants to create a space where families, young people, can come together,  and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.
And he doesn't grow roses because  they use too much water, by the way.
So the first step is to inspire young people,  and in that room, Mohamed's presence  had a really profound impact on the youth in that room.
They had never really thought about starting up a business.
They've thought about working for an NGO,  working for the government,  but his story, his innovation,  really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city  as a place of opportunity.
He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs,  that they could be change makers.
By the end of the day, they were coming up  to some of the biggest challenges facing their city.
They came up with entrepreneurial solutions  to local problems.
So inspiring young people  and creating a culture of entrepreneurship  is a really great step,  but young people need capital  to make their ideas a reality.
They need expertise and mentorship  to guide them in developing and launching their businesses.
Connect young people with the resources they need,  provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation,  and you will create catalysts for urban growth.
For me, entrepreneurship is more than just  starting up a business.
It's about creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I believe he is selling hope.
His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it,  when it's created, will actually transform  the way people see their city.
Aden hired street kids to help rent out  and maintain those bikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape  the paralysis of waithood. These young entrepreneurs are having  a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is,  turn youth into entrepreneurs, incubate and nurture their inherent innovation,  and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks  than of car bombs and waithood.
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old  on a camping trip with my dad  in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area  in the northern part of New York State.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest was sparkling.
The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,  and if it weren't for the path we were following,  we could almost pretend we were  the first human beings to ever walk that land.
We got to our campsite.
It was a lean-to on a bluff  looking over a crystal, beautiful lake,  when I discovered a horror.
Behind the lean-to was a dump,  maybe 40 feet square  with rotting apple cores  and balled-up aluminum foil,  and a dead sneaker.
And I was astonished,  I was very angry, and I was deeply confused.
The campers who were too lazy  to take out what they had brought in,  who did they think would clean up after them?
That question stayed with me,  and it simplified a little.
Who cleans up after us?
However you configure  or wherever you place the us,  who cleans up after us in Istanbul?
Who cleans up after us in Rio  or in Paris or in London?
Here in New York,  the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,  to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage  and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.
I wanted to get to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who takes the job.
What's it like to wear the uniform  and bear that burden?
So I started a research project with them.
I rode in the trucks and walked the routes  and interviewed people in offices and facilities  all over the city,  and I learned a lot,  but I was still an outsider.
I needed to go deeper.
So I took the job as a sanitation worker.
I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks.
And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege  and an amazing education.
Everyone asks about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think,  and on days when it is really bad,  you get used to it rather quickly.
The weight takes a long time to get used to.
I knew people who were several years on the job  whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden  of bearing on your body  tons of trash every week.
Then there's the danger.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,  sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous  occupations in the country,  and I learned why.
You're in and out of traffic all day,  and it's zooming around you.
It just wants to get past you, so it's often  the motorist is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the worker.
And then the garbage itself is full of hazards  that often fly back out of the truck  and do terrible harm.
I also learned about the relentlessness of trash.
When you step off the curb  and you see a city from behind a truck,  you come to understand that trash  is like a force of nature unto itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a form of respiration or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And then there's the stigma.
You put on the uniform, and you become invisible  until someone is upset with you for whatever reason  like you've blocked traffic with your truck,  or you're taking a break too close to their home,  or you're drinking coffee in their diner,  and they will come and scorn you,  and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them.
I find the stigma especially ironic,  because I strongly believe that sanitation workers  are the most important labor force  on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first guardians of public health.
If they're not taking away trash  efficiently and effectively every day,  it starts to spill out of its containments,  and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways.
Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries  burst forth again and start to harm us.
The economy needs them.
If we can't throw out the old stuff,  we have no room for the new stuff,  so then the engines of the economy  start to sputter when consumption is compromised.
I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship.
And then there's what I call  our average, necessary quotidian velocity.
By that I simply mean  how fast we're used to moving  in the contemporary day and age.
We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around our coffee cup, our shopping bag,  our bottle of water.
We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them,  because we know there's a workforce  on the other side that's going to take it all away.
So I want to suggest today a couple of ways  to think about sanitation that will perhaps help  ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation  of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.
Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical.
They're on the streets every day, rhythmically.
They wear a uniform in many cities.
You know when to expect them.
And their work lets us do our work.
They are almost a form of reassurance.
The flow that they maintain  keeps us safe from ourselves,  from our own dross, our cast-offs,  and that flow must be maintained always  no matter what.
On the day after September 11 in 2001,  I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street,  and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs  and there was a man doing his paper recycling route  like he did every Wednesday.
And I tried to thank him for doing his work  on that day of all days,  but I started to cry.
And he looked at me,  and he just nodded, and he said,  "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
It was a little while later that I started  my research with sanitation,  and I met that man again.
His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times,  and we became good friends.
I want to believe that Paulie was right.
But in our effort to reconfigure  how we as a species exist on this planet,  we must include and take account of  all the costs, including the very real human cost  of the labor.
And we also would be well informed  to reach out to the people who do that work  and get their expertise  on how do we think about,  how do we create systems around sustainability  that perhaps take us from curbside recycling,  which is a remarkable success across 40 years,  across the United States and countries around the world,  and lift us up to a broader horizon  where we're looking at other forms of waste
that could be lessened  from manufacturing and industrial sources.
Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage,  accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream.
It's a remarkable statistic.
So in the flow of your days,  in the flow of your lives,  next time you see someone whose job is  to clean up after you,  take a moment to acknowledge them.
Take a moment to say thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of  both thinking about our community life  being part of the environment  local conditions and traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects  Both projects are in emerging countries,  one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.
And also they have in common  that the different analyses from different perspectives  becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation  to design a multistory shopping mall  in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.
And this is the type of building  we were shown as an example, to my team and myself,  of what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was,  I want to run away.
After seeing a few of these buildings --  there are many in the city --  we realized that they have three very big points.
First, these buildings, they are almost empty  because they have very large shops  where people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, they need tons of energy to perform  because of the skin treatment with glass  that creates heat in the inside,  and then you need a lot of cooling.
In a city where this shouldn't happen  because they have really mild weather  that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.
And third is that their image has nothing to do  with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.
Also during our first visit to Ethiopia,  I was really captivated by the old merkato  that is this open-air structure  where thousands of people, they go and buy things  every day from small vendors.
And also it has this idea of the public space  that uses the outdoors to create activity.
So I thought, this is what I really want to design,  not a shopping mall.
But the question was how we could do a multistory,  contemporary building with these principles.
The next challenge was when we looked at the site,  that is, in a really growing area of the city,  where most of these buildings that you see in the image,  they were not there.
And it's also between two parallel streets  that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection  between these two streets,  putting all the entrances of the building.
And this extends with an inclined atrium  that creates an open-air space in the building  that self-protects itself with its own shape  from the sun and the rain.
And around this void  we placed this idea of the market with small shops,  that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I really wanted to find a solution  that would respond to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about the textile  like a shell made of concrete  with perforations that would let the air in,  and also the light, but in a filtered way.
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.
That they have fractal geometry properties  and this helped me to shape the whole facade.
And we are building that  with these small prefabricated pieces  that are the windows that let the air and the light  in a controlled way inside the building.
And this is complemented by these small colored glasses  that use the light from the inside of the building  to light up the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers  because they were like,  "This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that."
But then we all realized that this idea of the market  happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall  because basically they had more shops to sell.
And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,  not only because of the material compared with the glass,  but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.
So we created some budget savings  that we used to implement the project.
And the first implementation was to think  about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy  in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.
So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.
And then under those panels  we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars  that would create this urban oasis.
And these porches on the roof,  all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.
Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master plan  of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.
And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,  I really needed to understand the city of Tunis,  but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.
During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina  that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,  opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the site, the first design operation we did  was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks  similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona  and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.
On top of that, we selected some strategic points  reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,  and this modified this initial pattern.
And the last operation was to think about the cell,  the small cell of the project, like the apartment,  as an essential part of the master plan.
And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation  in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?
And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house  and then a natural ventilation.
So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments  are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result  that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with courtyards,  and then on the ground floor  you have all these connections for the pedestrians.
And also it responds to the local regulations that establish  a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.
The volume has this connecting shape  that shades itself with three different types of apartments  and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood  And in the courtyards there are the different facilities,  such as a gym and a kindergarten  and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project  is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.
And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,  and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,  jumping from one building to another.
These two examples,  they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see  the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow  changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more importance  to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions  that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment  and that aim to connect nature and people.
Thank you very much.
So when I was eight years old,  a new girl came to join the class,  and she was so impressive,  as the new girl always seems to be.
She had vast quantities of very shiny hair  and a cute little pencil case,  super strong on state capitals,  just a great speller.
And I just curdled with jealousy that year,  until I hatched my devious plan.
So one day I stayed a little late after school,  a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was clear, I emerged,  crept into the classroom,  and took from my teacher's desk the grade book.
And then I did it.
I fiddled with my rival's grades,  just a little, just demoted some of those A's.
All of those A's.   And I got ready to return the book to the drawer,  when hang on, some of my other classmates  had appallingly good grades too.
So, in a frenzy,  I corrected everybody's marks,  not imaginatively.
I gave everybody a row of D's  and I gave myself a row of A's,  just because I was there, you know, might as well.
And I am still baffled by my behavior.
I don't understand where the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt so great doing it.
I felt great.
I don't understand why I was never caught.
I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious.
I was never caught.
But most of all, I am baffled by,  why did it bother me so much  that this little girl, this tiny little girl,  was so good at spelling?
Jealousy baffles me.
It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive.
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone.
We know that jealousy is the number one cause  of spousal murder in the United States.
And yet, I have never read a study  that can parse to me its loneliness  or its longevity or its grim thrill.
For that, we have to go to fiction,  because the novel is the lab  that has studied jealousy  in every possible configuration.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say  that if we didn't have jealousy,  would we even have literature?
Well no faithless Helen, no "Odyssey."
No jealous king, no "Arabian Nights."
No Shakespeare.
There goes high school reading lists,  because we're losing "Sound and the Fury,"  we're losing "Gatsby," "Sun Also Rises,"  we're losing "Madame Bovary," "Anna K."
No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean,  I know it's fashionable to say that Proust  has the answers to everything,  but in the case of jealousy,  he kind of does.
This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, "In Search of Lost Time,"  and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy  and just regular competitiveness, my brand,  that we can hope to have.   And we think about Proust, we think  about the sentimental bits, right?
We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.
We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.
We forget how harsh his vision was.
We forget how pitiless he is.
I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said  were tough as cat gut.
I don't know what cat gut is,  but let's assume it's formidable.
Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.
Is it something as obvious as that jealousy,  which boils down into person, desire, impediment,  is such a solid narrative foundation?
I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone,  because let's think about what happens  when we feel jealous.
When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.
We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives,  and these stories make us feel terrible  because they're designed to make us feel terrible.
As the teller of the tale and the audience,  we know just what details to include,  to dig that knife in. Right?
Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists,  and this is something Proust understood.
In the first volume, Swann's Way,  Swann, one of the main characters,  is thinking very fondly of his mistress  and how great she is in bed,  and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences,  and these are Proustian sentences,  so they're long as rivers,  but in the course of a few sentences,  he suddenly recoils and he realizes,  "Hang on, everything I love about this woman,  somebody else would love about this woman.
Everything that she does that gives me pleasure  could be giving somebody else pleasure,  maybe right about now."
And this is the story he starts to tell himself,  and from then on, Proust writes that  every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress,  he adds to his "collection of instruments  in his private torture chamber."
Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit,  were notoriously jealous.
You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave  the country if they wanted to break up with him.
But you don't have to be that jealous  to concede that it's hard work. Right?
Jealousy is exhausting.
It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed.
And what does jealousy like?
Jealousy likes information.
Jealousy likes details.
Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair,  the cute little pencil case.
Jealousy likes photos.
That's why Instagram is such a hit.   Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy.
When Swann is in his jealous throes,  and suddenly he's listening at doorways  and bribing his mistress' servants,  he defends these behaviors.
He says, "You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant,  but it is no different  from interpreting an ancient text  or looking at a monument."
He says, "They are scientific investigations  with real intellectual value."
Proust is trying to show us that jealousy  feels intolerable and makes us look absurd,  but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge,  a quest for truth, painful truth,  and actually, where Proust is concerned,  the more painful the truth, the better.
Grief, humiliation, loss:  These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust.
He says, "A woman whom we need,  who makes us suffer, elicits from us  a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital  than a man of genius who interests us."
Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women?
No. I think he's trying to say  that jealousy reveals us to ourselves.
And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way?
Does any other emotion reveal to us  our aggression and our hideous ambition  and our entitlement?
Does any other emotion teach us to look  with such peculiar intensity?
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited  by this very anxious young man who was consumed  with the thought of his wife cheating on him.
And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy,  because he's not looking at what his wife is doing.
Because she's blameless; everybody knows it.
The poor creature is just  under suspicion for no cause.
But he's looking for things that his wife is doing  without noticing, unintentional behaviors.
Is she smiling too brightly here,  or did she accidentally brush up against a man there?
[Freud] says that the man is becoming  the custodian of his wife's unconscious.
The novel is very good on this point.
The novel is very good at describing how jealousy  trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy.
In fact, the more intensely jealous we are,  the more we become residents of fantasy.
And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't  just provoke us to do violent things  or illegal things.
Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways  that are wildly inventive.
Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede,  but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news.
A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught  creating a fake Facebook account  from which she sent vile, hideous messages  to herself for a year.
For a year. A year.
And she was trying to frame  her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend,  and I have to confess when I heard this,  I just reacted with admiration.
Because, I mean, let's be real.
What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right?
This is something from a novel.
This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel.
Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine.
She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters.
She's the author of "Strangers on a Train"  and "The Talented Mr. Ripley,"  books that are all about how jealousy,  it muddles our minds,  and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy,  the membrane between what is and what could be  can be pierced in an instant.
Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character.
Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you  or wanting what you have  to being you and having what you once had,  and you're under the floorboards,  he's answering to your name,  he's wearing your rings,  emptying your bank account.
That's one way to go.
But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route.
I can't give the world D's,  as much as I would really like to, some days.
And it's a pity, because we live in envious times.
We live in jealous times.
I mean, we're all good citizens of social media,  aren't we, where the currency is envy?
Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure.
So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure,  when they are in possession of a mystery.
Let's go to 221B Baker Street  and ask for Sherlock Holmes.
When people think of Holmes,  they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty,  right, this criminal mastermind.
But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade,  who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard  who needs Holmes desperately,  needs Holmes' genius, but resents him.
Oh, it's so familiar to me.
So Lestrade needs his help, resents him,  and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change,  and finally in "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,"  once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution,  Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says,  "We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes.
We're proud of you."
And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard  who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.
It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved  in the mysteries, and I find it very moving,  this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat jealousy  as a problem of geometry, not emotion.
You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade.
The next minute they're on the same side.
Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself  admire this mind that he's resented.
Could it be so simple though?
What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry,  just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand  in relation to another?
Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent  somebody's excellence.
We could align ourselves with it.
But I like contingency plans.
So while we wait for that to happen,  let us remember that we have fiction for consolation.
Fiction alone demystifies jealousy.
Fiction alone domesticates it,  invites it to the table.
sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley,  crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself.
We are in excellent company.
Thank you.
So, we used to solve big problems.
On July 21st, 1969,  Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11's lunar module  and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone,  but their presence on the moon's gray surface  was the culmination of a convulsive, collective effort.
The Apollo program was the greatest  in the history of the United States.
To get to the moon, NASA spent  around 180 billion dollars in today's money,  or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo employed around 400,000 people  and demanded the collaboration of 20,000  companies, universities and government agencies.
People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program ended,  24 men flew to the moon.
Twelve walked on its surface, of whom Aldrin,  following the death of Armstrong last year,  is now the most senior.
So why did they go?
They didn't bring much back:  841 pounds of old rocks,  and something all 24 later emphasized --  a new sense of the smallness  and the fragility of our common home.
Why did they go? The cynical answer is they went  because President Kennedy wanted to show  the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets.
But Kennedy's own words at Rice University in 1962  provide a better clue.
John F. Kennedy: But why, some say, the moon?
Why choose this as our goal?
And they may well ask,  why climb the highest mountain?
Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic?
Why does Rice play Texas?
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade,  and do the other things,  not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
Jason Pontin: To contemporaries,  Apollo wasn't only a victory of West over East  in the Cold War.
At the time, the strongest emotion  was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology.
They went because it was a big thing to do.
Landing on the moon occurred in the context  of a long series of technological triumphs.
The first half of the 20th century produced  the assembly line and the airplane,  penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle years of the century,  polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated.
Technology itself seemed to possess  what Alvin Toffler in 1970  called "accelerative thrust."
For most of human history,  we could go no faster than a horse  or a boat with a sail,  but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10  flew at 25,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human beings  have been back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew  of Apollo 10,  and blithe optimism about technology's powers  has evaporated  as big problems we had imagined technology would solve,  such as going to Mars,  creating clean energy, curing cancer,  or feeding the world have come to seem  intractably hard.
I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17.
I was five years old,  at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket.
I vaguely knew this was to be the last  of the moon missions,  but I was absolutely certain there would be  Mars colonies in my lifetime.
So "Something happened  to our capacity to solve big problems with technology"  has become a commonplace.
You hear it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here at TED.
It feels as if technologists have diverted us  and enriched themselves with trivial toys, with things like iPhones and apps and social media,  or algorithms that speed automated trading.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve humanity's big problems.
What happened?
So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley,  which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies  Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame,  in particular the incentives that venture capitalists  offer to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that venture investing  shifted away from funding transformational ideas  and towards funding incremental problems  or even fake problems.
But I don't think that explanation is good enough.
It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their most  risk-happy, they preferred small investments,  tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years.
V.C.s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy  whose capital requirements are huge  and whose development is long and lengthy,  and V.C.s have never, never funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems  that possess no immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems  are more complicated and more profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.
We could go to Mars if we want.
NASA even has the outline of a plan.
But going to Mars would follow a political decision  with popular appeal, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars, because everyone thinks  there are more important things  to do here on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems  because our political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent  of the world's energy consumption  derives from advanced, renewable sources  such as solar, wind and biofuels,  less than two percent,  and the reason is purely economic.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper  than solar and wind,  and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels.
We want alternative energy sources  that can compete on price. None exist.
Now, technologists, business leaders  and economists all basically agree  on what national policies and international treaties  would spur the development of alternative energy:  mostly, a significant increase in energy  research and development,  and some kind of price on carbon.
But there's no hope in the present political climate  that we will see U.S. energy policy  or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, big problems that had seemed technological  turn out not to be so.
Famines were long understood to be caused  by failures in food supply.
But 30 years of research have taught us  that famines are political crises  that catastrophically affect food distribution.
Technology can improve things like crop yields  or systems for storing and transporting food,  but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes elude solution  because we don't really understand the problem.
President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971,  but we soon discovered  there are many kinds of cancer,  most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy,  and it is only in the last 10 years  that effective, viable therapies  have come to seem real.
Hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology.
We can, we must, but these four elements  must all be present:  Political leaders and the public  must care to solve a problem;  institutions must support its solution;  It must really be a technological problem;  and we must understand it.
The Apollo mission,  which has become a kind of metaphor  for technology's capacity to solve big problems,  met these criteria.
But it is an irreproducible model for the future.
It is not 1961.
There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War,  no politician like John Kennedy  who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous,  and no popular science fictional mythology  such as exploring the solar system.
Most of all, going to the moon  turned out to be easy.
It was just three days away.
And arguably it wasn't even solving  much of a problem.
We are left alone with our day,  and the solutions of the future will be harder won.
God knows, we don't lack for the challenges.
Thank you very much.
So I'm going to talk about trust,  and I'm going to start by reminding you  of the standard views that people have about trust.
I think these are so commonplace,  they've become clichés of our society.
And I think there are three.
One's a claim: there has been a great decline in trust,  very widely believed.
The second is an aim: we should have more trust.
And the third is a task: we should rebuild trust.
I think that the claim, the aim and the task  are all misconceived.
So what I'm going to try to tell you today  is a different story about a claim, an aim and a task  which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter.
First the claim: Why do people think trust has declined?
And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence,  I don't know the answer.
I'm inclined to think it may have declined  in some activities or some institutions  and it might have grown in others.
I don't have an overview.
But, of course, I can look at the opinion polls,  and the opinion polls are supposedly  the source of a belief that trust has declined.
When you actually look at opinion polls across time,  there's not much evidence for that.
That's to say, the people who were mistrusted  20 years ago,  principally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted.
And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago  are still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in between,  and by the way, the average person in the street  is almost exactly midway.
But is that good evidence?
What opinion polls record is, of course, opinions.
What else can they record?
So they're looking at the generic attitudes  that people report when you ask them certain questions. Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?
Now if somebody said to you, "Do you trust greengrocers?
Do you trust fishmongers?
Do you trust elementary school teachers?"
you would probably begin by saying, "To do what?"
And that would be a perfectly sensible response.
And you might say, when you understood the answer to that,  "Well, I trust some of them, but not others."
That's a perfectly rational thing.
In short, in our real lives,  we seek to place trust in a differentiated way.
We don't make an assumption that the level of trust  that we will have in every instance of a certain type  of official or office-holder or type of person  is going to be uniform.
I might, for example, say that I certainly trust  a certain elementary school teacher I know  to teach the reception class to read,  but in no way to drive the school minibus.
I might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver.
I might trust my most loquacious friend  to keep a conversation going  but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret.
Simple.
So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives  of the way that trust is differentiated,  why do we sort of drop all that intelligence  when we think about trust more abstractly?
I think the polls are very bad guides  to the level of trust that actually exists,  because they try to obliterate the good judgment  that goes into placing trust.
Secondly, what about the aim?
The aim is to have more trust.
Well frankly, I think that's a stupid aim.
It's not what I would aim at.
I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy  but not in the untrustworthy.
In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.
And I think, of those people who, for example,  placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff,  who then made off with them,  and I think of them, and I think, well, yes,  too much trust.
More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life.
Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust  is the proper aim.
Well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay,  that means that what matters in the first place  is not trust but trustworthiness.
It's judging how trustworthy people are  in particular respects.
And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things.
Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?
And if we find that a person is competent  in the relevant matters,  and reliable and honest,  we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them,  because they'll be trustworthy.
But if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not.
I have friends who are competent and honest,  but I would not trust them to post a letter,  I have friends who are very confident  they can do certain things,  but I realize that they overestimate their own competence.
And I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends  who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest.
If so, I haven't yet spotted it.
But that's what we're looking for:  trustworthiness before trust.
Trust is the response.
Trustworthiness is what we have to judge.
And, of course, it's difficult.
Across the last few decades, we've tried to construct  systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions  and professionals and officials and so on  that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
A lot of these systems have the converse effect.
They don't work as they're supposed to.
I remember I was talking with a midwife who said,  "Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer  to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby."
And all over our public life, our institutional life,  we find that problem,  that is meant to secure trustworthiness  and evidence of trustworthiness  is actually doing the opposite.
It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks,  like midwives, from doing them  by requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say.
You can all give your own examples there.
So so much for the aim.
The aim, I think, is more trustworthiness,  and that is going to be different  if we are trying to be trustworthy  and communicate our trustworthiness to other people,  and if we are trying to judge whether other people  or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy.
It's not easy. It is judgment, and simple reaction,  attitudes, don't do adequately here.
Now thirdly, the task.
Calling the task rebuilding trust, I think,  also gets things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do that for ourselves.
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust.
But trust, in the end, is distinctive  because it's given by other people.
You can't rebuild what other people give you.
You have to give them the basis  for giving you their trust.
So you have to, I think, be trustworthy.
And that, of course, is because you can't fool  all of the people all of the time, usually.
But you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy.
How to do it?
Well every day, all over the place, it's being done  by ordinary people, by officials, by institutions,  quite effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back,  and they don't ask any questions.
They take them back and give me the money  or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted.
That's super. I trust them  because they have made themselves vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party,  then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy  and you have confidence in what you are saying.
So in the end, I think what we are aiming for  is not very difficult to discern.
It is relationships in which people are trustworthy  and can judge when and how the other person  is trustworthy. So the moral of all this is,  we need to think much less about trust,  let alone about attitudes of trust  detected or mis-detected by opinion polls,  much more about being trustworthy,  and how you give people adequate, useful  and simple evidence that you're trustworthy.
Thanks.
Throughout the history of computers  we've been striving to shorten the gap between us  and digital information,  the gap between our physical world  and the world in the screen  where our imagination can go wild.
And this gap has become shorter,  shorter, and even shorter,  and now this gap is shortened down  to less than a millimeter,  the thickness of a touch-screen glass,  and the power of computing  has become accessible to everyone.
But I wondered, what if there could be no boundary at all?
I started to imagine what this would look like.
First, I created this tool  which penetrates into the digital space,  so when you press it hard on the screen,  it transfers its physical body into pixels.
Designers can materialize their ideas  directly in 3D,  and surgeons can practice on virtual organs  underneath the screen.
So with this tool, this boundary has been broken.
But our two hands still remain outside the screen.
How can you reach inside and interact  with the digital information  using the full dexterity of our hands?
At Microsoft Applied Sciences,  along with my mentor Cati Boulanger,  I redesigned the computer  and turned a little space above the keyboard  into a digital workspace.
By combining a transparent display and depth cameras  for sensing your fingers and face,  now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard  and reach inside this 3D space  and grab pixels with your bare hands.
Because windows and files have a position in the real space,  selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf.
Then you can flip through this book  while highlighting the lines, words  on the virtual touch pad below each floating window.
Architects can stretch or rotate the models  with their two hands directly.
So in these examples,  we are reaching into the digital world.
But how about reversing its role  and having the digital information reach us instead?
I'm sure many of us have had the experience  of buying and returning items online.
But now you don't have to worry about it.
What I got here is an online augmented fitting room.
This is a view that you get from  head-mounted or see-through display  when the system understands the geometry of your body.
Taking this idea further, I started to think,  instead of just seeing these pixels in our space,  how can we make it physical  so that we can touch and feel it?
What would such a future look like?
At MIT Media Lab, along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii  and my collaborator Rehmi Post,  we created this one physical pixel.
Well, in this case, this spherical magnet  acts like a 3D pixel in our space,  which means that both computers and people  can move this object to anywhere  within this little 3D space.
What we did was essentially canceling gravity  and controlling the movement by combining  magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation  and sensing technologies.
And by digitally programming the object,  we are liberating the object from constraints  of time and space, which means that now,  human motions can be recorded and played back  and left permanently in the physical world.
So choreography can be taught physically over distance  and Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated  over and over as a physical reality.
Students can use this as a tool  to learn about the complex concepts  such as planetary motion, physics,  and unlike computer screens or textbooks,  this is a real, tangible experience  that you can touch and feel, and it's very powerful.
And what's more exciting  than just turning what's currently in the computer physical  is to start imagining how programming the world  will alter even our daily physical activities.
As you can see, the digital information  will not just show us something  but it will start directly acting upon us  as a part of our physical surroundings  without disconnecting ourselves from our world.
Today, we started by talking about the boundary,  but if we remove this boundary,  the only boundary left is our imagination.
Thank you.
So I was trained to become a gymnast  for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.
When I was in the first grade, the government  wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes,  all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become  an engineer like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution,  they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness:  a safe and well-paid job.
It is not important if I like the job or not.
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.
That is me playing my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start training young  to learn acrobatics,  so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.
I even wrote to the school principal  and the host of a radio show.
But no adults liked the idea.
No adults believed I was serious.
Only my friends supported me, but they were kids,  just as powerless as I was.
So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained.
My dream would never come true.
I was afraid that for the rest of my life  some second-class happiness  would be the best I could hope for.
So I was determined to find another calling.
Nobody around to teach me? Fine.
I turned to books.
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice  from this book by a family of writers and musicians.["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"]  I found my role model of an independent woman  when Confucian tradition requires obedience.["Jane Eyre"]  And I learned to be efficient from this book.["Cheaper by the Dozen"]  And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these.
["Complete Works of Sanmao" ] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin]  I came to the U.S. in 1995,  so which books did I read here first?
Books banned in China, of course.
"The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life.
That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for a different day.
"You shall honor your father and mother."
"Honor," I said. "That's so different,  and better, than obey."
So it becomes my tool to climb out  of this Confucian guilt trap  and to restart my relationship with my parents.
Encountering a new culture also started my habit  of comparative reading.
It offers many insights.
For example, I found this map out of place at first  because this is what Chinese students grew up with.
It had never occurred to me,  China doesn't have to be at the center of the world.
A map actually carries somebody's view.
Comparative reading actually is nothing new.
It's a standard practice in the academic world.
There are even research fields  such as comparative religion and comparative literature.
Compare and contrast gives scholars  a more complete understanding of a topic.
So I thought, well, if comparative reading  works for research, why not do it in daily life too?
So I started reading books in pairs.
["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] --  who are involved in the same event,  or friends with shared experiences.
["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder]  I also compare the same stories in different genres --   [Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] --  or similar stories from different cultures,  as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell]  For example, both the Christ and the Buddha  went through three temptations.
For the Christ, the temptations  are economic, political and spiritual.
For the Buddha, they are all psychological:  lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.
So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun  to read your favorite books in two languages.
["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts]  Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain.
For example, it's through translation that I realized  "happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh!
"Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh.
Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people  of the past and the present.
I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again.
Having a dream shattered really is nothing  compared to what many others have suffered.
I have come to believe that coming true  is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to get us in touch  with where dreams come from,  where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Even a shattered dream can do that for you.
So because of books, I'm here today,  happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity,  most of the time.
So may books be always with you.
Thank you.
Thank you.   Thank you.
When I was in my 20s,  I saw my very first psychotherapy client.
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top,  and she dropped onto the couch in my office  and kicked off her flats  and told me she was there to talk about guy problems.
Now when I heard this, I was so relieved.
My classmate got an arsonist for her first client.
And I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys.
This I thought I could handle.
But I didn't handle it.
With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session,  it was easy for me just to nod my head  while we kicked the can down the road.
"Thirty's the new 20," Alex would say,  and as far as I could tell, she was right.
Work happened later, marriage happened later,  kids happened later, even death happened later.
Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time.
But before long, my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life.
I pushed back.
I said, "Sure, she's dating down,  she's sleeping with a knucklehead,  but it's not like she's going to marry the guy."
And then my supervisor said,  "Not yet, but she might marry the next one.
Besides, the best time to work on Alex's marriage  is before she has one."
That's what psychologists call an "Aha!" moment.
That was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20.
Yes, people settle down later than they used to,  but that didn't make Alex's 20s a developmental downtime.
That made Alex's 20s a developmental sweet spot,  and we were sitting there, blowing it.
That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect  was a real problem, and it had real consequences,  not just for Alex and her love life  but for the careers and the families and the futures  of twentysomethings everywhere.
There are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now.
We're talking about 15 percent of the population,  or 100 percent if you consider  that no one's getting through adulthood without going through their 20s first.
Raise your hand if you're in your 20s.
I really want to see some twentysomethings here.
Oh, yay! You are all awesome.
If you work with twentysomethings, you love a twentysomething,  you're losing sleep over twentysomethings, I want to see —  Okay. Awesome, twentysomethings really matter.
So, I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe  that every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings  deserves to know what psychologists, sociologists, neurologists and fertility specialists  already know:  that claiming your 20s is one of the simplest,  yet most transformative, things you can do  for work, for love, for your happiness,  maybe even for the world.
This is not my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of life's most defining moments  take place by age 35.
That means that eight out of 10  of the decisions and experiences and "Aha!" moments  that make your life what it is  will have happened by your mid-30s.
People who are over 40, don't panic.
This crowd is going to be fine, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career  has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn.
We know that more than half of Americans  are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30.
We know that the brain caps off  its second and last growth spurt in your 20s as it rewires itself for adulthood,  which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself,  now is the time to change it.
We know that personality changes more during your 20s  than at any other time in life,  and we know that female fertility peaks at age 28,  and things get tricky after age 35. So your 20s are the time to educate yourself  about your body and your options.
So when we think about child development,  we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a time when your ordinary, day-to-day life  has an inordinate impact on who you will become.
But what we hear less about is that there's such a thing  as adult development,  and our 20s are that critical period of adult development.
But this isn't what twentysomethings are hearing.
Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood.
Researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence.
Journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings  like "twixters" and "kidults."
It's true!
As a culture, we have trivialized  what is actually the defining decade of adulthood.
Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things,  you need a plan and not quite enough time.
Isn't that true?
when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say,  "You have 10 extra years to start your life"?
Nothing happens.
You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition,  and absolutely nothing happens.
And then every day, smart, interesting twentysomethings  like you or like your sons and daughters  come into my office and say things like this:  "I know my boyfriend's no good for me,  but this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says as long as I get started  on a career by the time I'm 30, I'll be fine."
But then it starts to sound like this:  "My 20s are almost over, and I have nothing to show for myself.
I had a better résumé the day after I graduated from college."
And then it starts to sound like this:  "Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs.
Everybody was running around and having fun,  but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off  and everybody started sitting down.
I didn't want to be the only one left standing up,  so sometimes I think I married my husband  because he was the closest chair to me at 30."
Where are the twentysomethings here?
Do not do that.
Okay, now that sounds a little flip, but make no mistake, the stakes are very high.
When a lot has been pushed to your 30s,  there is enormous thirtysomething pressure  to jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up,  and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time.
Many of these things are incompatible,  and as research is just starting to show,  simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s.
The post-millennial midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car.
It's realizing you can't have that career you now want.
It's realizing you can't have that child you now want,  or you can't give your child a sibling.
Too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings  look at themselves, and at me, sitting across the room,  and say about their 20s,  "What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how that can go.
It's a story about a woman named Emma.
At 25, Emma came to my office  because she was, in her words, having an identity crisis.
She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment,  but she hadn't decided yet,  so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead.
Because it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend  who displayed his temper more than his ambition.
And as hard as her 20s were,  her early life had been even harder.
She often cried in our sessions,  but then would collect herself by saying,  "You can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends."
Well one day, Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap,  and she sobbed for most of the hour.
She'd just bought a new address book,  and she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts,  but then she'd been left staring at that empty blank  that comes after the words  "In case of emergency, please call ..."
She was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said,  "Who's going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck?
Who's going to take care of me if I have cancer?"
Now in that moment, it took everything I had  not to say, "I will."
But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really, really cared.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance.
I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex  to just sit there while Emma's defining decade  went parading by.
So over the next weeks and months,  I told Emma three things  that every twentysomething, male or female,  deserves to hear.
First, I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis  and get some identity capital.
By "get identity capital,"  I mean do something that adds value to who you are.
Do something that's an investment  in who you might want to be next.
I didn't know the future of Emma's career,  and no one knows the future of work,  but I do know this: Identity capital begets identity capital.
So now is the time for that cross-country job,  that internship, that startup you want to try.
I'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here,  but I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count,  which, by the way, is not exploration.
That's procrastination.
I told Emma to explore work and make it count.
Second, I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated.
Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport,  but twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers  limit who they know,  what they know, how they think,  how they speak, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person to date  almost always comes from outside the inner circle.
New things come from what are called our weak ties,  our friends of friends of friends.
So yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed.
But half aren't,  and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group.
Half of new jobs are never posted,  so reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that unposted job.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information spreads.
Last but not least, Emma believed  that you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends.
Now this was true for her growing up,  but as a twentysomething, soon Emma would pick her family  when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own.
I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now.
Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down  than 20, or even 25,  and I agree with you.
But grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with  when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle  is not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one,  and that means being as intentional with love  as you are with work.
Picking your family is about consciously choosing  who and what you want  rather than just making it work or killing time  with whoever happens to be choosing you.
So what happened to Emma?
Well, we went through that address book,  and she found an old roommate's cousin  who worked at an art museum in another state.
That weak tie helped her get a job there.
That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend.
Now, five years later, she's a special events planner for museums.
She's married to a man she mindfully chose.
She loves her new career, she loves her new family,  and she sent me a card that said,  "Now the emergency contact blanks  don't seem big enough."
Now Emma's story made that sound easy,  but that's what I love about working with twentysomethings.
They are so easy to help.
Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX,  bound for somewhere west. Right after takeoff, a slight change in course  is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji.
Likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29,  one good conversation, one good break,  one good TED Talk, can have an enormous effect  across years and even generations to come.
So here's an idea worth spreading  to every twentysomething you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.
It's what I now have the privilege  of saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day:  Thirty is not the new 20, so claim your adulthood,  get some identity capital, use your weak ties,  pick your family.
Don't be defined by what you didn't know  or didn't do.
You're deciding your life right now.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old,  I left a very demanding job in management consulting  for a job that was even more demanding: teaching.
I went to teach seventh graders math  in the New York City public schools.
And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests.
I gave out homework assignments.
When the work came back, I calculated grades.
What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference  between my best and my worst students.
Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores.
Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math,  sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram.
But these concepts are not impossible,  and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students  could learn the material  if they worked hard and long enough.
After several more years of teaching,  I came to the conclusion that what we need in education  is a much better understanding of students and learning  from a motivational perspective,  from a psychological perspective.
In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ.
But what if doing well in school and in life  than your ability to learn quickly and easily?
So I left the classroom,  and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist.
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings,  and in every study my question was,  who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy.
We tried to predict which cadets  would stay in military training and which would drop out.
We went to the National Spelling Bee  and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition.
We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods,  asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching  by the end of the school year,  and of those, who will be the most effective  at improving learning outcomes for their students?
We partnered with private companies, asking,  which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs?
And who's going to earn the most money?
In all those very different contexts,  one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ.
It was grit.
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.
Grit is having stamina.
Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out,  not just for the week, not just for the month,  but for years,  and working really hard to make that future a reality.
Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint.
A few years ago,  I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools.
I asked thousands of high school juniors  to take grit questionnaires,  and then waited around more than a year  to see who would graduate.
Turns out that grittier kids  were significantly more likely to graduate,  even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure,  things like family income,  standardized achievement test scores,  even how safe kids felt when they were at school.
So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters.
It's also in school,  especially for kids at risk for dropping out.
To me, the most shocking thing about grit  is how little we know,  how little science knows, about building it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me,  "How do I build grit in kids?
What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic?
How do I keep them motivated for the long run?"
The honest answer is, I don't know.   What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty.
Our data show very clearly  that there are many talented individuals  who simply do not follow through on their commitments.
In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated  or even inversely related to measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids  is something called "growth mindset."
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck,  and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed,  that it can change with your effort.
Dr. Dweck has shown  that when kids read and learn about the brain  and how it changes and grows in response to challenge,  they're much more likely to persevere when they fail,  because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit.
But we need more.
And that's where I'm going to end my remarks,  because that's where we are.
That's the work that stands before us.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions,  and we need to test them.
We need to measure whether we've been successful,  and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong,  to start over again with lessons learned.
In other words, we need to be gritty  about getting our kids grittier.
Thank you.
Growing up in Taiwan  as the daughter of a calligrapher,  one of my most treasured memories  was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape  and the form of Chinese characters.
Ever since then, I was fascinated  by this incredible language.
But to an outsider, it seems to be  as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.
Over the past few years, I've been wondering  if I can break down this wall,  so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate  the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so.
I started thinking about how a new, fast method  of learning Chinese might be useful.
Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw  every single stroke for each character  in the correct sequence.
I learned new characters every day  Since we only have five minutes,  it's better that we have a fast and simpler way.
A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters.
You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy.
The top 200 will allow you to comprehend  40 percent of basic literature --  enough to read road signs, restaurant menus,  to understand the basic idea of the web pages  or the newspapers.
Today I'm going to start with eight  to show you how the method works.
You are ready?
Open your mouth as wide as possible  until it's square.
You get a mouth.
This is a person going for a walk.
Person.
If the shape of the fire is a person  with two arms on both sides,  as if she was yelling frantically,  "Help! I'm on fire!" --  This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame,  but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you.
This is a tree.
Tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door  looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west.
I call these eight characters radicals.
They are the building blocks  for you to create lots more characters.
A person.
If someone walks behind, that is "to follow."
As the old saying goes,  two is company, three is a crowd.
If a person stretched their arms wide,  this person is saying, "It was this big."
The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped.
He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale.
One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods.
Three trees together, we create the forest.
Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot."   Easy to remember,  since a talking tree is pretty idiotic.
Remember fire?
Two fires together, I get really hot.
Three fires together, that's a lot of flames.
Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning.
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, prosperous.
Three together, that's sparkles.
Put the sun and the moon shining together,  it's brightness.
It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.
The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise.
A door. Put a plank inside the door,  it's a door bolt.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
Knock knock. Is anyone home?
This person is sneaking out of a door,  escaping, evading.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they have an argument.
Three women together, be careful, it's adultery.
So we have gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radicals  will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters  will build an extra 32.
So with very little effort,  you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters,  which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old.
So after we know the characters, we start building phrases.
For example, the mountain and the fire together,  we have fire mountain. It's a volcano.
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun.
This is a sun placed with the origin,  because Japan lies to the east of China.
So a sun, origin together, we build Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we get?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains  stacked on top of each other.
In ancient China, that means in exile,  because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies  in exile beyond mountains.
Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out.
A mouth which tells you where to get out  is an exit.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking  and get off of the stage. Thank you.
You know, my favorite part of being a dad  is the movies I get to watch.
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids,  and when my daughter was four,  we got to watch "The Wizard of Oz" together.
It totally dominated her imagination for months.
Her favorite character was Glinda, of course.
It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress  and carry a wand.
But you watch that movie enough times,  and you start to realize how unusual it is.
Now we live today, and are raising our children,  in a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex.
But "The Wizard of Oz" stood alone.
It did not start that trend.
Forty years later was when the trend really caught on,  with, interestingly, another movie  that featured a metal guy  and a furry guy  rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards.
Do you know what I'm talking about?   Yeah.
Now, there's a big difference between these two movies,  a couple of really big differences between "The Wizard of Oz"  and all the movies we watch today.
One is there's very little violence in "The Wizard of Oz."
The monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees.
But I think if "The Wizard of Oz" were made today,  the wizard would say, "Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz  that the prophecy foretold.
Use your magic slippers to defeat  the computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch."
But that's not how it happens.
Another thing that's really unique about "The Wizard of Oz"  to me is that all of the most heroic  and wise and even villainous characters  are female.
Now I started to notice this  when I actually showed "Star Wars" to my daughter,  which was years later, and the situation was different.
At that point I also had a son.
He was only three at the time.
He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that.
But he was the second child,  and the level of supervision had plummeted.   So he wandered in,  and it imprinted on him  like a mommy duck does to its duckling,  and I don't think he understands what's going on,  but he is sure soaking in it.
And I wonder what he's soaking in.
Is he picking up on the themes of courage  and perseverance and loyalty?
Is he picking up on the fact that Luke  joins an army to overthrow the government?
Is he picking up on the fact that  there are only boys in the universe  except for Aunt Beru, and of course this princess,  who's really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movie  so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink  to thank him for saving the universe, which he does  by the magic that he was born with?
Compare this to 1939 with "The Wizard of Oz."
How does Dorothy win her movie?
By making friends with everybody  and being a leader.
That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in --  Oz, right? -- and not the world of dudes fighting,  which is where we kind of have to be.
in the movies we have for our kids,  and so little yellow brick road?
There is a lot of great writing about the impact  that the boy-violent movie has on girls,  and you should do that reading. It's very good.
I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe.
I know from my own experience that  Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context  that I could have used in navigating the adult world  that is co-ed.   I think there was a first-kiss moment  when I really expected the credits to start rolling  because that's the end of the movie, right?
I finished my quest, I got the girl.
Why are you still standing there?
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
The movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain  and getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room  for other relationships and other journeys.
It's almost as though if you're a boy,  you are a dopey animal,  and if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume.
There are plenty of exceptions,  and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you.
But they do send a message to boys,  that they are not, the boys are not really the target audience.
They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls  how to defend against the patriarchy,  but they are not necessarily showing boys  how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy.
There's no models for them.
And we also have some terrific women  who are writing new stories for our kids,  and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are,  these are still war movies. And, of course, the most successful studio of all time  continues to crank out classic after classic,  every single one of them about  the journey of a boy, or a man,  or two men who are friends, or a man and his son,
or two men who are raising a little girl.
Until, as many of you are thinking, this year,  when they finally came out with "Brave."
I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now.
Do you remember what the critics said when "Brave" came out?
"Aw, I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie."
It's very good. Don't let that stop you.
Now, almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test.
I don't know if you've heard of this.
It has not yet caught on and caught fire,  but maybe today we will start a movement.
Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist,  and back in the mid-'80s, she recorded this conversation  she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw.
And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask:  Is there more than one character in the movie  that is female who has lines?
So try to meet that bar.
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie?
And is their conversation about something other than  the guy that they both like?   Right? Thank you.   Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff.
It does happen. I've seen it,  and yet I very rarely see it in the movies  that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see  a very high-quality movie, "Argo."
Right? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office,  a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.
It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie,  I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie  takes place in this embassy where men and women  are hiding out during the hostage crisis.
We've got quite a few scenes of the men  having deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout,  and the great moment for one of the actresses is  to peek through the door and say, "Are you coming to bed, honey?"
That's Hollywood for you.
So let's look at the numbers.
2011, of the 100 most popular movies,  how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists?
Eleven. It's not bad.
It's not as many percent as the number of women  we've just elected to Congress, so that's good.
But there is a number that is greater than this  that's going to bring this room down.
Last year, The New York Times published a study  that the government had done.
One out of five women in America  say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life.
Now, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment.
I don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that.
music videos or pornography are really directly related to that,  but something is going wrong,  and when I hear that statistic,  one of the things I think of is  that's a lot of sexual assailants.
Who are these guys? What are they learning?
What are they failing to learn?
Are they absorbing the story that  a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence  and then collect the reward, which is a woman  who has no friends and doesn't speak?
Are we soaking up that story?
You know,  as a parent with the privilege  of raising a daughter  like all of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this statistic very alarming  and we want to prepare them.
We have tools at our disposal like "girl power,"  and we hope that that will help,  but I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them  if, at the same time, actively or passively,  we are training our sons to maintain their boy power?
I mean, I think the Netflix queue  is one way that we can do something very important,  and I'm talking mainly to the dads here.
I think we have got to show our sons  a new definition of manhood.
The definition of manhood is already turning upside down.
You've read about how the new economy  is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner.
They're throwing it up in the air.
So our sons are going to have to find some way  of adapting to this, some new relationship with each other,  and I think we really have to show them, and model for them,  how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters  and respects them, and wants to be on their team,  and stands up against the real bad guys,  who are the men who want to abuse the women.
And I think our job in the Netflix queue  is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test,  if we can find them, and to seek out the heroines  who are there,  who show real courage, who bring people together,  and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines  and to say, "I want to be on their team,"  because they're going to be on their team.
When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "Star Wars,"  do you know what she said?
Obi-Wan.
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.
What do these two have in common?
Maybe it's not just the sparkly dress.
I think these people are experts.
I think these are the two people in the movie  who know more than anybody else,  and they love sharing their knowledge with other people  to help them reach their potential.
Now, they are leaders.
I like that kind of quest for my daughter,  and I like that kind of quest for my son.
I want more quests like that.
I want fewer quests where my son is told,  "Go out and fight it alone,"  and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team,  maybe a team led by women,  to help other people become better  and be better people,  like the Wizard of Oz.
Thank you.
When I was a child growing up in Maine,  one of my favorite things to do  was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine,  because my parents told me it would bring me luck.
But you know, these shells, they're hard to find.
They're covered in sand, they're difficult to see.
However, over time, I got used to looking for them.
I started seeing shapes  and patterns that helped me to collect them.
This grew into a passion for finding things,  a love for the past and archaeology.
And eventually, when I started studying Egyptology,  I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough.
Because all of the sudden, in Egypt,  my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine  to one eight hundred miles long,  next to the Nile.
And my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery.
For trying to map the past, I knew that I had to see differently.
So I want to show you an example of how we see differently  using the infrared.
This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta  called Mendes.
And the site visibly appears brown,  but when we use the infrared  and we process it, all of the sudden, using false color,  the site appears as bright pink.
What you are seeing  are the actual chemical changes to the landscape  caused by the building materials and activities  of the ancient Egyptians.
What I want to share with you today  is how we've used satellite data  to find an ancient Egyptian city,  called Itjtawy,  missing for thousands of years.
Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital  at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom,  about four thousand years ago.
The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt,  and the site is really important,  because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance  for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy  was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it,  indicated within the red circles here,  but somewhere within this massive flood plain.
This area is huge -- it's four miles by three miles in size.
The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy,  and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east,  it covered over the city.
So, how do you find a buried city  in a vast landscape?
Finding it randomly would be the equivalent  of locating a needle in a haystack,  blindfolded, wearing baseball mitts.
So what we did is we used NASA topography data  to map out the landscape, very subtle changes.
We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow.
But you can see in more detail, and even more interesting,  this very slight raised area  seen within the circle up here  which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy.
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists  to do coring work, which you see here.
When I say coring, it's like ice coring,  but instead of layers of climate change, you're looking for layers of human occupation.
And, five meters down,  underneath a thick layer of mud,  we found a dense layer of pottery.
What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy,  five meters down,  we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years,  dating to the Middle Kingdom,  dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is.
We also found work stone --  carnelian, quartz and agate  that shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here.
These might not look like much,  but when you think about the most common stones  used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom,  these are the stones that were used.
So, we have a dense layer of occupation  dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site.
showing that whatever was there was a very important city.
No Itjtawy was here yet,  but we're going to be returning to the site  in the near future to map it out.
And even more importantly,  we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology  so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well.
So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom --  it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy  four thousand years ago.
"Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings.
There's nothing like it in the land."
So as it turns out, TED was not founded in 1984 AD.
Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC  at a not-lost-for-long city, found from above.
It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I'd like to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home.
I'd like you to notice the color of the door,  the material that it's made out of.
Now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles.   They are competing in a naked bicycle race,  and they are headed straight for your front door.
I need you to actually see this.
They are pedaling really hard, they're sweaty,  they're bouncing around a lot.
And they crash straight into the front door of your home.
Bicycles fly everywhere, wheels roll past you,  spokes end up in awkward places.
Step over the threshold of your door into your foyer, your hallway,  whatever's on the other side, and appreciate the quality of the light.
The light is shining down on Cookie Monster.
Cookie Monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse.
It's a talking horse.
You can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose.
You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he's about to shovel into his mouth.
Walk past him into your living room.
In your living room, in full imaginative broadband,  picture Britney Spears.
She is scantily clad, she's dancing on your coffee table,  and she's singing "Hit Me Baby One More Time."
And then, follow me into your kitchen.
In your kitchen, the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road,  and out of your oven are coming towards you Dorothy, the Tin Man,  the Scarecrow and the Lion from "The Wizard of Oz,"  hand-in-hand, skipping straight towards you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a very bizarre contest  that is held every spring in New York City.
It's called the United States Memory Championship.
And I had gone to cover this contest a few years back  as a science journalist,  expecting, I guess, that this was going to be like the Superbowl of savants.
This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies,  widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep.
They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers,  looking at them just once.
They were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers.
They were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes.
They were competing to see who could memorize  the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest.
I was like, this is unbelievable.
These people must be freaks of nature.
And I started talking to a few of the competitors.
This is a guy called Ed Cook, who had come over from England,  where he had one of the best-trained memories.
And I said to him, "Ed, when did you realize  that you were a savant?"
And Ed was like, "I'm not a savant.
In fact, I have just an average memory.
Everybody who competes in this contest will tell you  that they have just an average memory.
We've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory  using a set of ancient techniques,  techniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece,  the same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches,  that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books."
And I said, "Whoa. How come I never heard of this before?"
And we were standing outside the competition hall,  and Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant, but somewhat eccentric English guy,  says to me, "Josh, you're an American journalist.
Do you know Britney Spears?"
I'm like, "What? No. Why?"
how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards  on U.S. national television.
It will prove to the world that anybody can do this."
I was like, "Well, I'm not Britney Spears,  but maybe you could teach me.
I mean, you've got to start somewhere, right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending the better part of the next year  not only training my memory,  but also investigating it, trying to understand how it works,  why it sometimes doesn't work,  and what its potential might be.
And I met a host of really interesting people.
This is a guy called E.P.
the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad,  that he didn't even remember he had a memory problem,  which is amazing.
And he was this incredibly tragic figure,  but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy.
This is Kim Peek, he was the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character  in the movie "Rain Man."
We spent an afternoon together in the Salt Lake City Public Library  memorizing phone books,  which was scintillating.
And I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises,  treatises written 2,000-plus years ago in Latin,  in antiquity, and then later, in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff.
One of the really interesting things that I learned  is that once upon a time,  this idea of having a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory  was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today.
Once upon a time, people invested in their memories,  in laboriously furnishing their minds.
Over the last few millenia,  we've invented a series of technologies --  from the alphabet, to the scroll,  to the codex, the printing press, photography,  the computer, the smartphone --  that have made it progressively easier and easier  for us to externalize our memories,  for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity.
These technologies have made our modern world possible,  but they've also changed us.
They've changed us culturally,  and I would argue that they've changed us cognitively.
Having little need to remember anymore,  it sometimes seems like we've forgotten how.
One of the last places on Earth where you still find  people passionate about this idea of a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory,  is at this totally singular memory contest.
It's actually not that singular,  there are contests held all over the world.
And I was fascinated, I wanted to know how do these guys do it.
A few years back a group of researchers at University College London  brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab.
They wanted to know:  Do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally,  anatomically different from the rest of ours? The answer was no.
Are they smarter than the rest of us?
They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests, and the answer was: not really.
There was, however, one really interesting and telling difference  between the brains of the memory champions  and the control subjects that they were comparing them to.
When they put these guys in an fMRI machine,  scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers  and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes,  they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain  than everyone else.
Of note, they were using, or they seemed to be using,  a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation.
Why? And is there something that the rest of us can learn from this?
The sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where,  every year, somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly,  and then the rest of the field has to play catch-up.
This is my friend Ben Pridmore,  three-time world memory champion.
On his desk in front of him are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards  that he is about to try to memorize in one hour,  using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered.
He used a similar technique  to memorize the precise order of 4,140 random binary digits  in half an hour.
Yeah.
And while there are a whole host of ways  of remembering stuff in these competitions,  everything, all of the techniques that are being used,  ultimately come down to a concept  that psychologists refer to as "elaborative encoding."
And it's well-illustrated by a nifty paradox  known as the Baker/baker paradox, which goes like this:  If I tell two people to remember the same word,  if I say to you,  "Remember that there is a guy named Baker."
That's his name.
And I say to you, "Remember that there is a guy who is a baker."
Okay? And I come back to you at some point later on,  and I say, "Do you remember that word that I told you a while back?
Do you remember what it was?"
The person who was told his name is Baker  is less likely to remember the same word  than the person was told his job is a baker.
Same word, different amount of remembering; that's weird.
What's going on here?
Well, the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you.
It is entirely untethered from all of the other memories  floating around in your skull.
But the common noun "baker" -- we know bakers.
Bakers wear funny white hats.
Bakers have flour on their hands.
Bakers smell good when they come home from work.
Maybe we even know a baker.
And when we first hear that word,  we start putting these associational hooks into it,  that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date.
The entire art of what is going on in these memory contests,  and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life,  is figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers  into lower-case B bakers --  to take information that is lacking in context,  in significance, in meaning,  and transform it in some way,  so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things  One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this
dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece.
It came to be known as the memory palace.
The story behind its creation goes like this:  There was a poet called Simonides, who was attending a banquet.
He was actually the hired entertainment,  because back then, if you wanted to throw a really slamming party,  you didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet.
And he stands up, delivers his poem from memory, walks out the door,  and at the moment he does, the banquet hall collapses.
Kills everybody inside.
It doesn't just kill everybody,  it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition.
Nobody can say who was inside,  nobody can say where they were sitting.
The bodies can't be properly buried.
It's one tragedy compounding another.
Simonides, standing outside,  the sole survivor amid the wreckage,  closes his eyes and has this realization,  which is that in his mind's eye,  he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting.
And he takes the relatives by the hand,  and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage.
What Simonides figured out at that moment,  is something that I think we all kind of intuitively know,  which is that, as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers,  and word-for-word instructions from our colleagues,  we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories.
If I asked you to recount the first 10 words of the story  that I just told you about Simonides,  chances are you would have a tough time with it.
But, I would wager that if I asked you to recall  who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse  in your foyer right now,  you would be able to see that.
The idea behind the memory palace  is to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye,  and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember --  the crazier, weirder, more bizarre,  funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is,  the more unforgettable it's likely to be.
This is advice that goes back 2,000-plus years  to the earliest Latin memory treatises.
So how does this work?
Let's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech,  and you want to do it from memory,  if he had been invited to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.
What you might do  is picture yourself at the front door of your house.
And you'd come up with some sort of crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image,  to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about  is this totally bizarre contest.
And then you'd go inside your house,  and you would see an image of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed.
And that would remind you  that you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook.
And then you'd see an image of Britney Spears  to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell.
And you'd go into your kitchen,  and the fourth topic you were going to talk about  was this strange journey that you went on for a year,  and you'd have some friends to help you remember that.
This is how Roman orators memorized their speeches --  not word-for-word, which is just going to screw you up,  but topic-for-topic.
In fact, the phrase "topic sentence" --  that comes from the Greek word "topos,"  which means "place."
That's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric  in these sorts of spatial terms.
The phrase "in the first place,"  that's like "in the first place of your memory palace."
I thought this was just fascinating,  and I got really into it.
And I went to a few more of these memory contests,  and I had this notion that I might write something longer  about this subculture of competitive memorizers.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory contest  is a pathologically boring event.
Truly, it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs --  I mean, the most dramatic it gets  is when somebody starts massaging their temples.
And I'm a journalist, I need something to write about.
I know that there's incredible stuff happening in these people's minds,  but I don't have access to it.
And I realized, if I was going to tell this story,  I needed to walk in their shoes a little bit.
And so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes  every morning, before I sat down with my New York Times,  just trying to remember something.
Maybe it was a poem,  maybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market.
And I found that this was shockingly fun.
I never would have expected that.
It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory.
What you're doing, is you're trying to get better and better  at creating, at dreaming up,  these utterly ludicrous, raunchy, hilarious,  and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye.
And I got pretty into it.
This is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit.
It's a pair of earmuffs  and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over  except for two small pinholes,  because distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy.
I ended up coming back to that same contest that I had covered a year earlier,  and I had this notion that I might enter it,  sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism.
It'd make, I thought, maybe a nice epilogue to all my research.
Problem was, the experiment went haywire.
I won the contest --  which really wasn't supposed to happen.
Now, it is nice to be able to memorize speeches  and phone numbers and shopping lists,  but it's actually kind of beside the point.
These are just tricks.
They work because they're based on some pretty basic principles  about how our brains work.
And you don't have to be building memory palaces  or memorizing packs of playing cards  to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with great memories  as though it were some sort of an innate gift,  but that is not the case.
Great memories are learned.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we are deeply engaged.
We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience,  and figure out why it is meaningful to us,  why it is significant, why it's colorful,  when we're able to transform it in some way that makes sense  in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds,  when we're able to transform Bakers into bakers.
The memory palace, these memory techniques --  they're just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even really shortcuts.
They work because they make you work.
They force a kind of depth of processing,  a kind of mindfulness,  that most of us don't normally walk around exercising.
But there actually are no shortcuts.
This is how stuff is made memorable.
And I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with,  it's what E.P., the amnesic who couldn't even remember he had a memory problem,  left me with,  which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose  from our already short lives,  by losing ourselves in our Blackberries, our iPhones,  by not paying attention to the human being across from us  who is talking with us,  by being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply?
I learned firsthand  that there are incredible memory capacities  latent in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life,  you have to be the kind of person  who remembers to remember.
Thank you.
i will go.
the two companies final presentations will be next week. heh that means
but then again, i'm not a betting man.
i can see that your twinly bond is firm.

no joking.
so that you can make that process much simpler.
i think we don't have much of a choice.

i'm the one getting nominated as director.
go ahead and walk out.
i respect the strategy.

we have to leave.
it's perfect.
there's something i want to try.
uh, like we were telling marshal jennings here...
so, what's he saying?
did you try to get it to work?

well, why not?
it doesn't exist anymore.

someone killed karen and david.
my own mother and i should say this here
we're not gonna leave you here when you're sick.
because gone are the horrid conditions

mr. whitaker, do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency, alcoholism or drug addiction?
you're like, damn, my face
let's go.
hurry up!
the years are changing, we're coming up to modern times
you work by learning
relax.
babe.

so, what do they want?
and tell that person!
this is sugata's present.

i wish i could become friends with her.
do what you have to do.
if you don't do everything i say, everything...
we said, that was so great, we saved this little girl's life.
just like daisensei said...
yeah. but because the body is the host's capital.

Rinzai Zen Buddhism is one of the Chinese five Houses/seven Schools of Zen (Rinzai, Igyou, Soto, Unmon, Hogan) and Gigen RINZAI (? - 867) of Tang was its founder.
He was known as "RINZAI of Katu (meaning to help wake up the sleeping mind) " and "General RINZAI", and rose to the top of Chinese Zen with his distinctive style.
With its Zen Talks that try to awaken self awareness through study of Koan, it differs from the Silent Zen of the Soto sect, which just does meditation.
Rinzai School in China
As the name implies, Rinzai School started with its founder Gigen RINZAI at the end of the Tang dynasty, after the anti-Buddhist movement at the Kaishou era.
RINZAI was the disciple of Kiun OBAKU; the school grew as a religious movement centered in the province of Hebei, with the support of Changshi WANG of the Hanchin government, but in the confusion that arose around the end of the Tang dynasty, Hebei was at the center of the tumultuous five dynasties and it became difficult to sustain a religious movement.
The central figure around that time was Enshou FUKETSU.
It was in the Northern Song dynasty that Rinzai School became vibrant again, below the gates of Sekiso SOEN, along with Enan OURYU and Houe YOUGI who came from Jiangxi province and created the two main sectes of Rinzai (Ouryu and Yougi), and swept across all of China.
When it came to the Southern Song dynasty, Soukou DAIE, a disciple of Kokugon ENGO who belonged to the Yougi sect, started the Daikan sect in Zhejiang province, which became a major sect in the Rinzai School.
Rinzai School in Japan
According to doctrine, it was brought over to China from India by Bodhidharma, the 28th successor of the 10 disciples (called Kasho) who directly received the teaching (enlightenment) of Siddhartha Gautama.
Later the Rinzai school, which achieved the pinnacle of Zen teaching, was brought to Japan in the Kamakura period by Eisai, who went to China to study in the Southern Song period.
Japan's Rinzai is one of Zen schools in Japan.
It emphasizes the transmission of enlightenment from teacher to disciple. (Hassu is the disciple who inherited the teaching of the master.)
It calls Sakyamuni the Original Teacher Venerable Sakyamuni Buddha, Bodhidharma the First Ancestor and Great Teacher Bodhidharma, and RINZAI the Founder and Great Teacher Rinzai.
In contrast to the Soto Zen school which spreads through regional clans and the general people, the Rinzai School received support from Samurai families in government, and was esteemed in the politics and culture.
Later, the Rinzai School was rebuilt in the Edo period by Master HAKUIN, and continued to be called Hakuin Zen.
Traditions
Transmission of enlightenment from masters to disciples continues down to the present day (Hassu is the disciple who inherited the teaching of the master).
The important interaction between the master and disciple is called "a secret in the room" and is not to be taken out of the master's room and revealed publicly.
What is extracted from the interactions between a master and disciple, or Zen lecture transcripts that record the actions of a master, is called a Koan (precedent) and various collections have been compiled since the Song dynasty; but enlightenment is not something that can be communicated with words, so when people today try to understand the text, the Koan itself refuses them.
However, they contain hints that lead people toward enlightenment, and there are a great many Zen books from the beginning down to the present day.
Also since the Song dynasty, the Zen schools changed to a Kannazen style in which masters give lectures using transcripts of Zen talks and the masters became not to display the same majesty as those in the Tang dynasty including Rinzai.
Although masters choose their successors when they die, the successors have not necessarily attained enlightenment by that time, but that fact is only known to the master and the successor himself.
Even if the new master had not attained enlightenment, the disciples would have been able to do so if it is within a few generations from that of the master who gained enlightenment, therefore it is possible to take such a measure.
It is possible for a master to leave behind several new masters, or at his discretion not to leave a successor and bring his line to an end.
Many lines have split, and some have disappeared; in this way some of those lines have come down from the 7th century to the present day.
Enlightenment
The Zen sects generally emphasize enlightenment over knowledge.
Enlightenment in Zen means that all living things realize the inherent buddha nature they possess.
For this reason, masters in the Tang dynasty struggled to enlightenment through much hardship.
However, they began to devise many techniques for gaining enlightenment from the Song dynasty.
These were systematized so that enlightenment could be gained by performing training such as Zazen (not the same as meditation), Koan (understanding stories that surpass intellectual understanding), Dokyou (reading sutras), or Samu (everyday work) under an already enlightened Zen master.
Enlightenment is thought to pass from the master to the disciple as a candle flame passes to a candle that is unlit (called Dentou).
That is not a transmission based on words (logos).
For this reason, it is considered crucial to choose the right Zen master.
That means not just choosing one who has gained enlightenment, but one who fits with one's own personality.
Actually, it does not mean that an enlightened Zen master instructs and enables someone gain enlightenment.
Masters in the Tang dynasty did not learn to get enlightenment from anybody - not to mention Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha, Shakuson), who gained enlightenment without a teacher.
While it is impossible to define enlightenment with words, words are one of many methods that can describe the boundaries of enlightenment.
That is why, especially after it was brought to Japan, enlightenment has been expressed through artistic expression such as poetry and painting, so that one can get a taste of its aroma.
Other than in art, it is also expressed in deportments such as tea ceremony and flower arrangement; and methods to get a taste of the world of enlightenment have also been born.
That is not an intellectual understanding.
The Koan System
The Koan system came together after the Song dynasty, and though they might be fabricated it has made even more enlightenments possible.
Most Koan are made up of conversations between a master and disciple, telling the truth of the moment when the disciple gained enlightenment.
Koan cannot be received with logical, intellectual understanding, and are stories beyond logic that can be understood only by completely becoming the Koan itself instead of thinking.
The Koan system was established by collecting these Koan stories as a method for leading disciples and was composed of 500 to 1900 Koan stories.
Koan system differs according to the master's style.
Examples of Koan stories in the beginning.
"Does a dog have buddha-nature?" "It does not have."
As the background, any Buddhist knows that "all living things have Buddha-nature."
The Sound of One Hand Clapping
A disciple has to listen to the sound of clapping with one hand and show that to the master.
By intellectual understanding, it is impossible to clap with one hand and make a sound.

Fushimi-jo Castle was a castle in what is now Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City.
"Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle" is a recent construction that did not exist historically (details to follow).
Fushimi-jo Castle was originally built by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI for his own residence after retirement.
Construction spanning the reigns of 3 emperors, it was first built on Mt. Shizuki, there called Shizuki Fushimi-jo Castle, and after an earthquake was moved to Mt. Kohata and named Kohata Fushimi-jo Castle.
Furthermore, there was the Kohata Fushimi-jo Castle that was built in the days of Toyotomi, and the one that was rebuilt in the Tokugawa days after being destroyed in the battle of Sekigahara.
After Hideyoshi's death and in accordance with his will, Hideyori TOYOTOMI moved to Osaka-jo Castle; after which Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, leader of the council of 5 elders, moved into this castle and took over government.
Although it was protected by Ieyasu's vassals, Mototada TORII et alia, during the Battle of Sekigahara, it was attacked and burned by Ishida (the Siege of Fushimi-jo Castle).
It was later rebuilt by Ieyasu; and after it was razed its structures and materials were moved to other locations.
After it was razed, the location of the citadel was made into a peach orchard and was called Momoyama (Peach Mountain).
That is why Fushimi-jo Castle is typically called Momoyama-jo Castle; and this is the reason why the period of Oda-Toyotomi government is called the "Azuchi-Momoyama Period" and the culture of the time called "Momoyama Culture".
According to the account that says the descendants of the family that reclaimed the land are the Yoshimura family, which founded Yoshimura Shuzo, they were the heads of Horiuchi Village, built on the ruins of Fushimi-jo Castle; and it is said that they transferred village land to the Imperial Household in the Meiji Period.
Historically, there was no direct connection.
Since the Tokugawa-era keep was moved to Nijo-jo Castle, there is a relatively large number of artifacts left; but there is much that is unclear about the previous keep.
The details are unclear.
1592 - In the low-lying hills along the Uji-gawa River where Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI made his home on Mt. Shizuki in retirement, parts of the dismantled Jurakudai were transferred for the building of a castle (Shizuki-jo Castle).
1596 - Because it was destroyed in an earthquake, a new castle was built about 500 meters away on Mt. Kohata (present day Mt. Momoyama).
1598 - Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI died in this castle
1600 - Burned in the Siege of Fushimi Castle
1601 - Rebuilt by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA
1603 - Was the site of the inauguration of Seii Taishogun
Fushimi-jo Castle's functions moved to Osaka-jo Castle after the Siege of Osaka, reducing this castle's importance in the eyes of the Edo Shogunate; and it was therefore razed in 1625 after Ieyasu TOKUGAWA's retirement.
1964 - Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle Land, an amusement park featuring a mock castle keep "Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle", was built on the site of the Fushimi-jo Castle flower garden.
January 2003 - Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle Land was closed as part of the restructuring of its parent company, Kintetsu Corporation.
Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle escaped destruction thanks to a movement by the people of Kyoto to preserve it as a symbol of Fushimi.
Nowadays it is maintained as a park.
The City of Kyoto received it at no cost; but the inside is closed to the public because it has deteriorated with age.
October 2007 - When it was remodeled to look like Osaka-jo Castle for the filming of a period movie, "Chacha: The Woman from Far Away", the tiger decorations below the watch tower and Shachihoko were painted gold.
With Toei Films bearing the remodeling cost of around 1 million yen, work to remake it into Osaka-jo Castle continues within the year.
When the castle was dismantled, the keep and many other buildings were moved to other locations.
The most famous are Nijo-jo Castle and Jojakko-ji Temple; the turrets, castle gate, palace, bath, Tamon Yagura Turret, and earthen walls all were moved to Fukuyama-jo Castle (Bingo Province).
Below is a list of major items that are thought to have been moved and still exist.
Note: Among these, the only ones that can be proven are the guest hall of Saikyo-ji Temple, which is the remains from Mt. Shizuki, and Fukuyama-jo Castle's Fushimi Yagura, which is left over from the Tokugawa era.

The Kanoha group is the largest gaha (group of painters) in Japanese art history, and was active for about 400 years from the middle of the Muromachi period (fifteenth century) to the end of the Edo period (nineteenth century) as a group of expert painters that consistently dominated the art world.
Masanobu KANO, the official painter of the Muromachi shogunate, was the earliest ancestor; his descendants worked for Nobunaga ODA, Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and the Tokugawa Shogun as painters after the collapse of the Muromachi shogunate, consistently dominating the art world associated with the powers-that-be, thus greatly influencing Japanese art circles as a professional painter group working on works ranging from screen paintings in the Imperial Palace, castles or large temples to small paintings such as those created on fans.
The Kanoha group is a painter group mainly concerned with consanguinity such as parents or brothers; it reigned over the nation's realm of art for as long as four centuries, a period unequaled anywhere in the world.
Prominent painters of the Kanoha group include the founder Masanobu KANO, who worked for Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA, the eighth Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Muromachi shogunate; his heir, Motonobu KANO, a grandson of Motonobu; Eitoku KANO, who created screen paintings of the Azuchi and Osaka castles; a grandson of Eitoku, Tanyu KANO, who moved from Kyoto to Edo and supervised the creation of screen paintings of Edo Castle and Nijo Castle; Sanraku KANO, who stayed in Kyoto, thus representing a group called 'Kyo Kano.'
Once the structure of the Edo shogunate had become stable, the members of the Kanoha group were driven to get extensive orders done for screen paintings of the Imperial Palace and castles as the shogunate's official painters.
In order to fulfill large numbers of orders for screen paintings, the head of the Kano family needed to lead the painters so they could work in a group.
Consequently, the painters of the Kanoha group needed to learn ancestral painting examples and ways of painting without expressing their individuality as painters.
Given such an historical backdrop, it can be said that the Kanoha group after Tanyu KANO only tried to keep the tradition and maintain influence as official painters, and therefore lost its artistic drive.
In the present day, an artist's expression of individuality and mentality is valued, so the evaluation of paintings of the Kanoha group is not necessarily high.
However, it is a fact that the Kanoha group led the Japanese art world for about four centuries and that numbers of painters were developed by the group; thus one can hardly discuss the history of Japanese painting but exclude the Kanoha group, whether in positive or negative terms.
It is also a fact that many Japanese painters after the early years of the modern age were influenced by the Kanoha group and started with the influence of the Kanoha group; initially, Korin OGATA, of the Rinpa group, and Okyo MARUYAMA of the Shaseiha group had learned from the Kanoha group.
The Kanoha group was founded by Masanobu KANO (c. 1434 - 1530), who worked as the official painter for the Muromachi shogunate.
He lived quite long for a Japanese of the time (it is commonly believed that he died at age 97), and worked from the middle of the fifteenth century until the early sixteenth century.
It is said that he was from the Izu area, but that is uncertain.
Due to the progress of study after the late twentieth century, it is speculated that the Kano family was somehow related to the Nagao clan in Ashikaga, Shimotsuke Province (Ashikaga City, Tochigi Prefecture); and "Waterfall," an ink painting that remains at Chorin-ji Temple in Ashikaga City, is considered a relatively early work by Masanobu.
The first painting work recorded as having been done by Masanobu is the screen paintings he did of the Deity of Mercy and Luohan in Unchoin, Shokoku-ji Temple Tower, which he did in Kyoto at the age of 30 in 1463. This was just before the turmoil of the Onin War (1467 - 1477) (as reported in Inryoken Nichiroku (Inryoken's Diary)), which tells us that Masanobu was already working as a painter in Kyoto by that time.
Shokoku-ji Temple, as the main temple building of Unchoin, where Masanobu created the screen paintings, is a Zendera temple constructed by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, the third Shogun of the Muromachi shogunate; it is the heart of the Muromachi art world, which produced artist-monks such as Josetsu, Shubun, Sesshu; moreover, in those days Sotan (Sotan OGURI, 1413 - 1481), an artist-monk who was a disciple of Shubun, worked as an official painter.
Although it is not exactly certain when Masanobu KANO went to Kyoto, whom he studied under and when he became the official painter for the Muromachi shogunate, it is clear (according to certain records) that Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA, the eighth Shogun of the Muromachi shogunate, gave him an important position.
In 1481, a few years after the tumultuous Onin War (1467 - 1477), which had lasted for a decade, Sotan, the official painter for the Muromachi shogunate, died; thus it is thought that Masanobu KANO was appointed as the official painter for the shogunate, succeeding Sotan.
Subsequently, Mitsunobu TOSA, of the Yamatoe group (a style of Japanese painting) who was in the postion of Edokoro-azukari (a leader of painters who worked for the Imperial Court) of the Imperial Court, and Masanobu KANO of the Kanga (a Chinese style of painting) group, became two major forces in the art world.
In 1482, the former Shogun, Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA, started the construction of Higashiyama dono (the predecessor of Ginkaku-ji Temple), and Masanobu took charge of the screen paintings.
Following the death of Yoshimasa in 1490, Masanobu worked for the Hosokawa clan, which had political power at the time.
In this way Masanobu solidified his position in the art world while deepening his relationship with the powers-that-be, and built a foundation for the subsequent prosperity of the Kanoha group.
According to records, it is known that Masanobu created works in various styles and subjects, including screen paintings and Buddhist paintings; however, all his screen paintings have been lost and the existing works are limited to small paintings such as a hanging scroll.
His painting style was 'kanga,' with ink painting based on the brushwork of Sung and Yuan in China, in contrast to the traditional Yamatoe of his contemporary, Mitsunobu TOSA.
Although Masanobu lived until age 97, it isn't clear what work he produced during the last 30 years, and it seems he had his heir Motonobu assume the work of painting as he went into retirement.
The second generation, Motonobu KANO (1476 - 1559), who built the basis of prosperity of the Kanoha group, was the heir of Masanobu.
His best existing works include the screen paintings in the hojo of Daisenin, Daitoku-ji Temple (the hojo, or chief priest's room, was completed in 1513) and another one in Reiunin, Myoshin-ji Temple in 1543 (it is widely believed that the screen paintings in Daisenin were not created at the time the hojo was completed but were done in a slightly later period).
The creation of the screen paintings in the hojo of Daisenin was divided among Soami, Motonobu and his brother Yukinobu KANO, depending on the room; accordingly, Motonobu took charge of "Four Seasons, Flowers and Birds" in 'Danna no Ma' and "Founder of the Zenshu sect" in 'Ihatsu no Ma.'
"Founder of Zenshu sect" is a typical ink painting, while "Four Seasons, Flowers and Birds" is based on ink and shows a new flavor at the same time, as it uses colors only on the flowers and birds.
Motonobu strengthened the ties with the Ashikaga Shogun and the Hosokawa clan as the powers-that-be, had numerous disciples and consolidated the basis of the Kanoha as a group of painters.
He accepted orders from court nobles, temples and shrines as well as samurai families; and as for temples and shrines it is known that he created the screen paintings of Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple in Osaka according to the historical record, but this no longer exists.
Because Motonobu referred to himself as 'Echizen no kami' in his later life, he was given a priestly rank called 'Hogen' however, for posterity he has been referred to as 'Kohogen' or 'Echizen Hogen.'
The work is wide-ranging: he created the Engi Emaki of temples and shrines, votive pictures, gilded folding screens in the Yamatoe style, and portraits as well as screen paintings.
Motonobu assumed the Yamatoe painting style in Kanga and ink painting (in which his father Masanobu specialized); he specialized in large decorative paintings such as a Fusuma (Japanese sliding door) and a folding screen, and built a foundation for the style of the Kanoha group.
He is also called the founder of the early modern screen paintings as he established the concept of calligraphy painting styles such as Shintai (standard style), Gyotai (semi-cursive style), and Sotai (cursive style).
Motonobu had three sons: Munenobu, Hideyori and Naonobu; Naonobu (1519 - 1592); the first, Munenobu, died young, and the third son Naonobu succeeded as the head of family.
It is not clear why their family estate was transferred to the third son Naonobu instead of Hideyori, the second son.
Naonobu is widely known as Shoei KANO (his posthumous name), and he was active from the Muromachi period to the Momoyama period.
The huge "Nirvana" (six meters long) in Daitoku-ji Temple is his finest work.
Although he participated in the creation of the screen paintings for the Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple with his father Motonobu as well as in the creation of the screen paintings for the Jukoin, Daitoku-ji Temple with his son Eitoku, he was a less famous artist because his father Motonobu and his son Eitoku were more prominent.
Eitoku KANO (1543 - 1590), the heir of Shoei, is also called Kuninobu; he is one of the most distinguished painters of the Japanese art world from the Momoyama period.
Although he created numbers of screen paintings in strict compliance with the plans of the men in power who had survived wild times--including Nobunaga ODA and Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI--these paintings were lost with the buildings, so relatively few of Eitoku's works remain in existence.
The paintings on the partitions in the hojo of Jukoin, Daitoku-ji Temple (which are among his best existing works) were created by Eitoku together with his father Shoei; however, Shoei had Eitoku take charge of Fusumae of the major room in the south front of the hojo, while he took a supporting role.
In the days of feudal society it was a common practice that the head of a family would create Fusumae in the major room, so it is historically believed that, at the time such paintings were created, Shoei had already retired after transferring the family estate to Eitoku, who was a great talent.
"Flowers and Birds" in Shitchu (the center front room of Hojo) is very highly acclaimed among the screen paintings of Hojo of Jukoin.
Subsequently, Eitoku became involved in the creation of the screen paintings in Azuchi Castle Tower, which Nobunaga ODA constructed during the period from 1576 to 1579.
He created screen paintings in the Osaka Castle of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and Jurakudai after Nobunaga died, and in his later years also became involved in creating the screen paintings in the Imperial Palace.
These works were highly acclaimed for their originality in the journals and records of the time, so they would be Eitoku's best works if they existed; however, these paintings were lost with the buildings.
As Eitoku's existing best works, the screen paintings in the hojo of Jukoin, as previously described, are renowned as well as "Foo dogs, folding screen" as former imperial property, and "Urban and suburb of Kyoto, folding screen," as handed down through the Uesugi clan; it has also been said that "Cypress, folding screen" in the Tokyo National Museum was painted by Eitoku.
Eitoku excelled at elaborate paintings and monumental paintings, although he had no choice but to paint in the monumental painting style in order to fill a large number of orders for screen paintings.
An elaborate painting is interpreted as a work described in every detail, and monumental painting is interpreted as having a high-minded style.
The Kanoha group also had the most important painters in the early modern ages.
"Viewing Maple Leaves in Takao," a designated national treasure, has the seal of 'Hideyori'; it has been said that this was painted by Hideyori KANO (birth and death dates unknown), the second son of Motonobu KANO; however, it is also said that this 'Hideyori' of "Viewing Maple Leaves in Takao" is another painter called Hideyori SHINSHO, a grandson of Motonobu.
Soshu KANO (1551 - 1601) was a brother of Eitoku, also called Motohide, and worked as an assistant to Eitoku in the creation of the screen paintings in Azuchi Castle.
Folding screens and portraits still in existence have been attributed to him.
Naganobu KANO (1577 - 1654), another brother of Eitoku, is renowned as the painter of "Playing Under the Flowering Trees," a national treasure.
As painters other than the direct line of the Kano family, Yoshinobu KANO (1552 - 1640), who painted "Craftspeople, folding screen" in Kawagoe Kitain, and Naizen KANO (1570 - 1616), who painted "Hokoku Festival, folding screen" in Kyoto Toyokuni-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City), are well known.
Eitoku KANO died at age 48, preceding his father Shoei (Naonobu).
Eitoku's first son Mitsunobu KANO (c. 1565 - 1608) and second son Takanobu KANO (1571 - 1618) succeeded him.
Mitsunobu created the screen paintings in the Reception Hall of Kangakuin, Onjo-ji Temple; in contrast to Eitoku he specialized in delicate painting in the Yamatoe style.
Such a style of painting might not have suited the public taste at the time, and the early modern essays on paintings, including "Honchogashi," generally put a low value on Mitsunobu.
After the death of the Kano ｆamily head Mitsunobu, his brother Takanobu led the Kanoha group because his son Sadanobu KANO (1597 - 1623) was only 12 years of age.
Under the feudal system, the family line of Sadanobu, Mitsunobu's first son, was supposed to be the head of family; however, Sadanobu died without an heir at the age of just 27, so after that the legitimacy of the Kano family was the descendant of Takanobu till the end of the Edo period.
Takanobu had three sons--Morinobu (Tanyu 1602 - 1674), Naonobu KANO (1607 - 1650) and Yasunobu KANO(1613 - 1685)--and they respectively became the earliest ancestor of the Kajibashi Kano family, Kobikicho Kano family and Nakabashi Kano family.
Although the youngest son, Yasunobu, succeeded as the Kano head of family as an adopted son of Sadanobu (mentioned above), the most renowned painter was Morinobu (also known as Tanyu).
Morinobu later became a priest and called himself Tanyusai; as a painter he is known as Tanyu KANO.
He eventually moved to Edo and solidified the position of the Kanoha group in the art world more as the official painter of the Edo shogunate.
Tanyu exercised his painting talent from childhood; in 1612, he met Ieyasu TOKUNAGA in Sunpu at the age of 11 and obtained a residence in Edo Kajibashi Mongai in 1621, subsequent to which he worked based in Edo and energetically created screen paintings in castles and large temples.
Among Tanyu's works, the screen paintings in the Edo and Osaka castles were lost with the buildings, but the screen paintings (ink paintings) in Jorakuden of Nagoya Castle are existent, having avoided an air raid during World War II because they had been removed from the building and evacuated; additionally, the screen paintings in Ninomaru Palace of Nijo Castle and the hojo of Daitoku-ji Temple are among his best existent works.
He created various kinds of works, including hanging rolls, picture scrolls and folding screens, as well as these large paintings.
He created the screen paintings in Ninomaru Palace of Nijo Castle when he was young (25 years of age), and they showed dynamism in Eitoku's style; however, the screen paintings in Daitoku-ji Temple, which he created later in his life (mainly with ink and water), display a calm approach with abundant use of blank space.
He had works in the Yamatoe style in picture scrolls and folding screens as well.
Tanyu emphasized sketches and the copying of ancient paintings; consequently, he left numerous sketch books and reproduction books.
Many of Tanyu's copies of ancient paintings (called 'Tanyu Reduction') are existent, which are now part of museums and collections around the nation, and they include many copies of ancient paintings whose originals are now lost, so they are valuable as data for the study of Japanese art history.
The Kanoha group during the Edo period was a huge painting group comprised of a consanguinity group mainly with the head family of the Kano family and numerous disciples around the nation, thus comprising a hierarchy.
They are clearly ranked: under the most prestigious four families (called 'inner court painters') there are about 15 families less prestigious called 'outer court painters' and then the 'Machi Kano painters' who catered to the demands of townspeople instead of the Imperial Court or temples and shrines; and consequently their influence spread throughout the nation.
The powers of the time sought the stability and continuity of feudal society, and the paintings for public places such as Edo Castle were supposed to be painted in the style of traditional painting examples; they were not intended to be unique.
In order to create numbers of screen paintings, one must work in a group with all the disciples; therefore, in order to make group work easier, the ability to learn from painting examples was valued more than one's individuality as a painter.
In this respect it is undeniable that the paintings of the Kanoha group lack individuality and originality.
It is said that the inner court painters ranked with Hatamoto and were allowed 'audience' with the Shogun as well as belting on a sword, which implies a high status.
The four families of the inner court painters are the Kajibashi family, with lineage of Tanyu (the first son of Takanobu KANO); the Kobikicho family (called Takekawa-cho family at the time), with lineage of Naonobu (the second son of Takanobu); the Nakabashi family with lineage of Yasunobu (the third son of Takanobu); and the Hamacho family, with lineage of Minenobu KANO (1662 - 1708) (Minenobu is the second son of Tsunenobu KANO, the first son of Naonobu KANO).
Because Tanyu had no child, he adopted Toun (Masunobu KANO 1625 - 1694), the son of Ryujo GOTO, a swordsmith.
Later, Morimasa KANO (1653 - 1718) who was his biological son (born after Tanyu turned 50) succeeded him, but subsequently this lineage had no distinguished painter.
Among the numerous disciples of Tanyu, Morikage KUSUMI (birth and death dates unknown), the creator of "Enjoying the Cool of the Evening Under the Moonflower Trellis," is renowned.
Morikage was for some reason expelled from the Kanoha group; he worked in the Kanazawa area later, but his records aren't completely clear.
As stated previously, the head family of Kano was succeeded by the Nakabashi Family of Yasunobu, a brother of Tanyu.
Tokinobu KANO (1642 - 1678), a son of Yasunobu, died in his thirties, and his son Ujinobu KANO (1675 - 1724) succeeded the family estate; however, subsequently this lineage had no distinguished painter.
Itcho HANABUSA (1652 - 1724), who was popular based on his sophisticated painting style, was a disciple of Yasunobu.
The family that produced relatively prominent painters until the end of the Edo period among the four families of the inner court painters is the Kobikicho family, of Naonobu's lineage.
This family line produced Tsunenobu KANO (1636 - 1713), the heir of Naonobu, and Tsunenobu's sons, Chikanobu KANO (1660 - 1728) and Minenobu KANO (1662 - 1708).
Minenobu won the favor of the Shogun Ienobu TOKUGAWA, and he later gained independence as 'Hamacho family,' which was ranked as one of the inner court painter families.
Besides them, Koi KANO (date of birth unknown - 1636) was not related by blood to the Kano family but, along with his brothers, was a master of Tanyu; he was allowed to use the surname of Kano due to his achievements, and he worked for the Kishu Tokugawa family.
Meanwhile, a group called 'Kyo Kano' remained active in Kyoto, and Sanraku KANO (1559 - 1635), a disciple of Eitoku KANO, was the pillar of the group.
Sanraku was from the Kimura clan in Omi, the vassal of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI; his original name was Mitsuyori KIMURA.
His best works are "Peonies" and "Red and White Plum Trees" in the main house of Kyoto Daikaku-ji Temple, and they have colorful and decorative pictures on a golden base.
Sansetsu KANO (1589/90 - 1651), the husband of Sanraku's daughter, created the screen paintings in Tenkyuin, Myoshin-ji Temple as well as some paintings of folding screens, which are still in existence.
He had a distinctive painting style unique among painters of the Kanoha group, such as distinct shapes of trees and rocks, as well as the completeness of detail.
The essay on paintings made by Sansetsu and edited by his son Eino KANO (1631 - 1697) is entitled "Honchogashi," the first full-fledge painting history book by a Japanese.
The Kobikicho family produced Michinobu KANO (Michinobu EISENIN (1730 - 1790)), Korenobu KANO (Korenobu YOSENIN (1753 - 1808)), Naganobu KANO (Naganobu ISENIN (1775 - 1828)) and Osanobu KANO (Osanobu SEISENIN (1786 - 1846)) during the late Edo period.
Osanobu SEISENIN led the creation of numerous screen paintings as a master of the Kanoha group during the reconstruction of the Nishinomaru and Honmaru palaces of Edo Castle, which had burned down in 1838 and again in 1844.
Although the paintings are no longer in existence, numerous designs are in the possession of the Tokyo National Museum.
SEISENIN also endeavored to copy and collect ancient paintings.
Although the painters of the Kanoha group in the late Edo period are not well appreciated generally, there is a move to reappraise SEISENIN as the progress of the study after the late twentieth century recognizes that he was a painter with good technique who eagerly studied art from ancient paintings and on to the new painting movement at the end of the Edo period.
Hogai KANO (born in Shimonoseki, 1828 - 1888), a leading figure of the Japanese art world during the early Meiji period, like Gaho HASHIMOTO (born in Kawagoe, 1835 - 1908), was a disciple of Tadanobu KANO (Tadanobu SHOSEN'IN 1823 - 1880), the next generation of SEISENIN.
Both Hogai and Gaho were from painter families of the Kanoha group.
The historical role of the Kanoha group as a professional painter group finished as its patron, the Edo shogunate, ended.
Personal information of Emperor SHIRAKAWA
Emperor SHIRAKAWA (7th July 1053 - 24th July 1129) was the 72nd Emperor.
SHIRAKAWA came to power on the 18th January 1073 and reigned until 5th anuary 1087.
His posthumous name was Sadahito.
SHIRAKAWA was the first son of Emperor Go-Sanjo who had little maternal relationship with the Fujiwara Five Regent Houses, and his mother, Nyogo, FUJIWARA no Moshi/Shigeko was from Fujiwara Kaninryu, the daughter of Chunagon FUJIWARA no Kinnari, and the adopted daughter of Togu Daibu FUJIWARA no Yoshinobu.
His half sister was Princess Tokushi/Atsuko (Empress of Horikawa)
Genealogy
When he was young, he and his father were snubbed due to their background, but after his father was enthroned in 1068 (Jiryaku 4), he was proclaimed a Shinno (Imperial prince) and became Imperial Prince Sadahito.
In 1069 he became Crown Prince, and became an Emperor three years later, when he was twenty years old.
A Kanpaku was assigned, but SHIRAKAWA attempted to rule directly like his father had done, after his father, the retired Emperor, died of illness in 1070 (Jiryaku 5), and also attempted to regulate the Shoen(manor) system thereby trying to weaken the influence of the Regent/Kanpaku Houses.
Go-Sanjo-in and Go-Sanjo-in's mother, Yomeimon-in, wished for SHIRAKAWA's younger half brother, Prince Sanehito (Heian period) and then Sanehito`s younger brother Prince Sukehito to succeed to the throne, and upon abdication to SHIRAKAWA, Prince Sanehito was decided to become Crown Prince.
SHIRAKARA repelled against this and later Prince Sanehiro died from illness in 1085 (Otoku 2).
As a result, in November, 1086 (Otoku 3), SHIRAKAWA proclaimed his own eight year old son, Prince Taruhito (73rd Emperor Horikawa) to be the Crown Prince instead of Prince Sukehito and SHIRAKAWA abdicated immediately.
Retired Emperor SHIRAKAWA, who became Daijo Tenno, acted as the guardian of the young Emperor, and ruled personally as Shirakawa-in, and this style of government became known as Insei system (cloistered style).
Through such system, although the Sessho and Kampaku offices continued, they did not have actual power to rule the government.
SHIRAKAWA continued to have exert power even after Emperor Horikawa turned twenty years old and he strengthened his despotic position by appointing aids from the Juryro and Samurai class.
The Samurai soldiers were assigned to such posts as the "Hokumen no bushi" which was newly established to protect the retired Emperor.
SHIRAKAWA was a strict Buddhist and he became a Cloistered Emperor with posthumous Buddhist name of Yukan after the death of his daughter in 1096 (Kaho 3).
SHIRAKAWA ordered the building of many temples and Buddhist statues including the Hossho-ji Temple, and he took advantage of getting finance from Juryo.
After Emperor Horikawa died, SHIRAKAWA ruled using a cloistered government for forty three years through three generations of young Emperors, until he died on 24th July 1129 (7th July Taiji 4), and he supported both his grandson 74th Emperor Toba and his great grandson 75th Emperor Sutoku.
This is called "Chiten no kimi".
The Cloistered Emperor Shirakawa had supreme power, but it was said he mented that, he has no control over the following three things: 1. Waters of the Kamo River (tributary of the Yodo River)(due to its flow and frequent flooding); 2. Dice used in sugoroku (different from current sugoroku, close to western backgammon), which was popular way of gambling at that time, with spots on the dice selecting winners/losers; and 3. Yamaboshi (monk soldiers from Mt. Hie Enryaku-ji Temple), which show that SHIRAKAWA had absolute control apart from these three things.
SHIRAKAWA is also known for many relationships with women and the rumor that Emperor Sutoku and TAIRA no Kiyomori may be SHIRAKAWA's illegitimate sons, was widely spread and believed at the time.

SHIRAKAWA was also named Rokujotei.
He was named Emperor SHIRAKAWA in and after Taisho period.

The Emperor was entombed in Jobodaijin no misasagi located in Takedajobodaiincho, Fushimi district, Kyoto City.
Near this Jobodaiin, there is another poossible place that SHIRAKAWA was entombed in, which is regulated by the Imperial Household Agency as Ryobo sankouchi.
All the past Emperors are enshrined in Koreiden, one of the Three Palace Sanctuaries.
Emperor Shirakawa initially wished to be buried after his death, and often mentioned this to his people, but he suddenly ordered to be cremated, when he learnt that the body of FUJIWARA no Moromichi, who was buried, was in the danger of being humiliated by monk soldiers of Kofuku-ji Temple, who were known to be opposed to Moromichi when Moromichi was alive, and planned to attack and open Moromichi's grave.
It is said the Emperor's body was cremated in the Kita district, Kyoto City at a crematorium, monument of which still exists near the Kinkaku Elementary School.

The Kujo Family is one of the Sekke and a court noble.
The progenitor of this family was Kanezane KUJO, the third son of FUJIWARA no Tadamichi, a direct descendant of the Fujiwara-hokke (the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan).
The family name comes from the fact that the Kujo Family lived in Kujo-den, which was located in Kyoto Kujo and said to have been built by FUJIWARA no Mototsune.
This individual was a duke after the Meiji Restoration.
The crest is Kujo-Fuji Crest.
A descendant of FUJIWARA no Kanefusa (grand minister of state), the younger brother-uterine of Kanezane, he is sometimes included in the Kujo family but Kanefusa's family line failed at an early stage.
The children of Michiie KUJO, a grandchild of Kanezane--Norizane KUJO, Yoshizane KUJO and Sanetsune KUJO--became regents to the emperor and started the Kujo Family, Nijo Family and Ichijo Family, respectively, thus constituting Gosekke.
Kanezane KUJO inherited the fief of the elder sister by a different mother, Kokamonin, which became the foundation of the Kujo Family fiefdom.
Kanezane was critical of the Taira clan administration and Pope Goshirakawa; he became regent by recommendation of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo and then chief advisor to the Emperor, whereupon the Konoe and Kujo families took positions as regents to the emperor.
Kanezane's grandson, Michiie KUJO, gained power in the Imperial court since Michiie's son Yoritsune KUJO, and then Yoritsune's son Yoritsugu KUJO, became Sekke Shogun in the Kamakura Shogunate.
Kanezane's diary, "Gyokuyo (Kanezane KUJO's Diary)," is famous.
The Kujo family's fiefdom continued to expand during medieval times. They held the lordship of Karoku, an area of land that yielded 2,000 koku of rice in the Edo era and 3,000 koku later on, until the Meiji era.
Setsuko, the fourth daughter of the duke Michitaka KUJO, who was Hisatada KUJO's firstborn, became empress to the Emperor Taisho (Empress Teimei).
Conflict over legitimate blood between the Kujo and Ichijo families
Michiie KUJO lost the legitimate heir, Norizane KUJO, and the second son, Yoshizane KUJO, was practically repudiated.
Michiie gave Tadaie KUJO, Norizane's son and Michiie's grandchild, to be the legitimate heir, a shobunjo (a kind of will) to give instructions that documents such as diaries (which were the most important heritage for a court noble at the time) should be inherited by the Ichijo Family, but that the head of a family who controls the family temples such as Tofuku-ji Temple should first be inherited by Sanetsune ICHIJO, the third son of Michiie, then by Tadaie KUJO, a child of the eldest son of Michiie, and later by either descendant of the Kujo Family or the Ichijo Family who took the highest-ranking official position (head of a clan).
In accordance with Michiie's will, Sanetsune ICHIJO's descendant inherited the position as head of the family after Michiie died.
Thereafter, the predominance of the Ichijo Family was maintained for over 100 years, whereby the position of the Ichijo Family as legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu (Kujo family line) was well established.
When Tsunemichi ICHIJO died in 1365 (the Hokucho period), during the Muromachi era, Tsunenori KUJO--who had gained the second position of power after the Ichijo Family--made an appeal to the Emperor Gokogon that Fusatsune ICHIJO, a son of Tsunemichi, had fraudulently identified himself as the head of family.
At that time, primogeniture was becoming the common practice, and Tsunenori claimed that according to primogeniture the Kujo Family, the descendant of the eldest son of Michiie, should inherit the family estate.
Fusatsune ICHIJO argued against Tsunenori, stating that just because an ancestor of the Kujo Family was the firstborn child it did not mean the Kujo Family was the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu, and that because Michiie KUJO gave the family estate to Sanetsune ICHIJO, the Tokado-bunko (Gonnjo-moromichi-ki) (Gonijo-moromichi record), Gyokuyo (Kanezane KUJO's diary) and Gyokuzui (Michiie KUJO's diary)) and the document endorsing the political authority of Kujo-ryu Sekkan-ke, a regent family, were inherited by the ICHIJO Family; whereas Tsunenori KUJO asserted that measures to give inheritance to Sanetsune were taken just because Tadaie KUJO was in infancy, and that if Norizane KUJO had lived longer it would not have happened.
Tunenori further asserted that Tadaie KUJO was named as the receiver of the shobunjo (executor of the will) and the land patent of the premise of Tofuku-ji Temple had been inherited by the Kujo Family because the Kujo was the legitimate blood.
Considering the political position of the Kujo Family at that time, the emperor gave Rinji to the Kujo Family on November 29 (lunar calendar), in the same year giving the verdict that the will of Michiie was no more than the inheritance of the head of a family by the head of a clan and that the Kujo and Ichijo families, both having the qualification, were on equal footing as legitimate blood.
The Ichijo Family was the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu during the Kamakura era, but after the middle Muromachi period the position of the Kujo Family was elevated and the Ichijo and Kujo families were considered to be the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu.
The Kujo Family started inheriting the Matsudono Family's fiefdom after the Middle Edo period; thus the Kujo possessed the largest Kokudaka, lived in a huge house and claimed to be the legitimate blood of Kujo-ryu.

Old Kujo-tei was in the southwest area of the present-day Kyoto Gyoen.
Today only the garden remains, on the basis of maintenance.
Itsukushima-jinja Shrine, which was then called Chinju-sha, still exists on the island of the garden pond (KUJO-ike), and a simple but elegant tearoom called Shusui-tei is found near the pond.
The major buildings (such as the main building) were transferred to Kujo-tei in Tokyo in accordance with the order issued during the early Meiji era, and were recently donated by the Kujo Family to the Tokyo National Museum, which was named Kujo-kan.
Yamashiro no Kuni, located in Kinai, was one of the administrative province (Ryoseikoku).
It was situated in the southern part of present day Kyoto.
It was also called Joshu (unusually it is also alled Sanshu) or Yoshu.
In the Engishiki, it is ranked as Kokushi-kuni tokyu (a Kokushi (official) governing province).
"Yamashiro" was written as 山代 in ancient times, and in the 7th century, the province (kuni) was founded with the name written as 山背国.
On November 8, 794 (Enryaku 13), when the capital was named Heian-kyo (Heian Palace), the Emperor Kammu changed the second letter of the province's name to 山城国
Based on the writings of "mokkan"－strips of wood used for writing during the Heijo-kyo (Heijo Palace) period, the notations of Yamashiro no Kuni as 山代国 and 山背国 seem to have coexisted with 山城国.
According to Wamyo Ruijusho, the provincial government office (Kokufu) was situated at the Kaya Imperial Villa (Kaya Detached Palace).
On the other hand, it is recorded as "Otokuni-gun (Otokuni District), Fu (Office)" in Shugaisho.
In the colophon and afterward titled "Keicho-two Enirinshi" of Setsuyoshu (proofed by Ekirin) it is also recorded as "Otokuni-gun (Otokuni District), Fu (Office)."
As for Shugosho (governor's office), at first, the mansion of the Gokenin of Kyoto Shugo (Kyoto governor) was designated because the person holding the post of Kyoto Shugo concurrently took charge of Yamashiro Province's Shugo.
Later, Rokuhara Tandai held the post of the Province Shugo, and therefore, the office (Shugosho) was moved to Rokuhara.
In Muromachi period, the Yamashiro Province was divided along the Uji River into three upper districts and five lower districts; after an associate shugo (shugodai) was designated to each district the Shugosho in charge of the three upper districts was situated in Uji Makishima, while Shugosho for the five lower districts were placed in several places such as Yodo.
Ichinomiya (primary shrine), Provincial monastery (temple), and Others
The provincial temple －with monastery for priests as well as convent for priestess－, were located in Soraku District.
The Daigokuden Hall of the Kuni no Miya Shrine was designated as a monastery (soji) in 746.
It was burned down in 882.
Afterwards it was reconstructed but its influence declined.
In Kamakura period, it seems that the temple was categorized as the lowest level temple within the Byodo-in school
The provincial temple was located at present day Kamo-cho, Kizugawa city.
In 1925 (14th year of Taisho) a large number of old [roof] tiles were excavated near the provincial temple, and implying that there was a convent there.
In Engi-Shiki Jinmei-cho (shrines' name directory) a total of 122-za and 96-sha are recorded, consisting of 53-za/37-sha of taisha (big shrines)(within these shrines, 23-za/16-sha of dai myojin are included) and 69-za/59-sha of shosha (small shrines). In addition to these shrines, 36-za (30 big za, and 6 small za) in the imperial court and 3-daiza in Kyoto are also registered.
Kamo Shrines are the first shrines (Ichinomiya) in Kyoto －Kamowakeikazuchi Shrine (called Kamigamo Shrine) at Kita district, and Kamomioya Shrine (called Shimogamo Shrine) at Sakyo district.
Unlike in other local provinces, it is considered that Jingi-kan had some influence over the designation of the first shrine (Ichinomiya) in Yamashiro Province; because of this, while the establishment of Ichinomiya in other provinces took place starting at the end of the 11th century the designation of Ichinomiya in Kinai (Kansai Region) began during the 12th century.
There is no secondary (Ninomiya) and lower level shrines.
As for the soja shrine, the information is not available.

The Ikedaya Incident is the name given to an event that took place on July 8,1864 towards the end of the Edo Period in which the Shinsen-gumi, who was a peacekeeping organization under the Kyoto protectorate, attacked the imperial loyalist faction from Choshu who were hiding out at the Ikedaya Inn at Kiyamachi (Sanjou-Kobashi Bridge) on Sanjou-Street in Kyoto.
It is also known as the Ikedaya Rebellion, the Ikedaya Uprising, or the Sanjou-kobashi Disturbance.
Isami KONDO called it the Rakuyo Upheaval in his writings.
Kyoto at the end of the Edo period was the center of political power struggles, and ronins (masterless samurai) from different feudal clans who held such ideas as "revere the emperor, expel foreigners" and imperialists were active behind the scenes.
The Choshu clan was overthrown by the Aizu and Satsuma clans in a coup on August 18th, and the Shogunate-Imperial faction became the mainstream in the imperial court.
The "revere the emperor, expel foreigners" faction was trying to recover its strength, and the Kyoto protectorate used the Shinsen-gumi for security and searches in the city.
At around the end of May, moderators and observers including Susumu YAMAZAKI and Kai SHIMADA ascertained the presence of Masuya store (Shuntaro FURUTAKA) that was operating a charcoal business in Shijo-Kobashi-Agaru-Shin-cho, and made a report to the Aizu clan.
Weapons and communications with the Choshu clan were found.
The Shinsen-gumi captors requested Toshizo HIJIKATA to torture FURUTAKA, who was coerced into a confession.
The plan was to wait for a windy day before the Gion festival and set fire to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, and in the ensuing confusion confining Prince Asahiko NAKAGAWANOMIYA (who became Asahiko KUNINOMIYA later), assassinate Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI (Yoshinobu TUGAWA) and Katamori MATSUDAIRA of the Aizu clan, and take Emperor Koumyou to Choshu.
Furthermore, the search revealed that the loyalists from the Choshu, Tosa, and Higo clans were planning to hold a meeting at Ikedaya or Shikokuya to discuss whether or not to go forward with the plan of attack after hearing about the arrest of FURUTAKA.
The Shinsen-gumi had asked for support from the Aizu, Kuwana, and other clans, but their actions were too slow, and they did not move when the time came.
That is why the boss, Isami KONDO, knowing that every moment counted, acted alone by splitting their members into two squads under KONDO and HIJIKATA and began the search.
At the time, the Shinsen-gumi was short-handed because many members were sick, so only 34 members took part in the search - 10 in the KONDO squad and 24 in the HIJIKATA squad (There are different views on the number. cf. List of Soldiers Involved).
The HIJIKATA squad, a part of the Shinsen-gumi, searched Nawate Street from Yasaka Shrine, while the KONDO squad searched Kiyamachi Street across the Sanjo Bridge.
At the end of the search, the KONDO squad found radical nationalists who were having a meeting at Ikedaya.
A few members of the KONDO squad attacked them and got into a battle in the middle of the night.
Four of the members - Isami KONDO, Soji OKITA, Shinpachi NAGAKURA, and Heisuke TODO - first attacked the 20-some radical nationalists while the rest shored up the perimeter.
Some ronins frantically attacked Hayatarou ANDO, Eisuke OKUZAWA and Kakuzaemon NITTA who guarded the back door, and succeeded to escape.
OKUZAWA died in the attack, and ANDO and NITTA died a month later.
OKITA went inside the building and fought hard, but collapsed during the battle and withdrew from it.
Some accounts say that this was because of a tuberculosis-related blood spitting, but there is a lot of doubt and it is not certain.
Then, a sword hit the forehead of TODO on the first floor when sweat caused his helmet to slip out of place, and he withdrew from the battle.
Although there were KONDO and NAGAKURA only at one point, the arrival of the HIJIKATA squad tilted the odds in favor of the Shinsen-gumi and achieved a result of nine people killed and four arrested.
Aizu and Kuwana clans arrived there to support them after the battle.
HIJIKATA would not let them anywhere near, to ensure that they could not take credit.
Although some of the radical nationalists escaped from the battle, the next morning more than 20 people were arrested by carrying out clearing operations with Aizu, Kuwana, and other clans.
The sweep of the city turned violent, and there were 5 immediate deaths among the Aizu clan, four among the Hikone clan, and two among the Kuwana clan.
At noon of the following day, the Shinsen-gumi returned to their base in Mibu Village. (If they had returned to their base at night, they might have fallen into an ambush, so they took a rest in the city until dawn.)
It is said that the roadside was crowded with onlookers.
The name of the Shinsen-gumi, which succeeded in preventing the plot to burn down the imperial palace, became famous throughout the land.
The "revere the emperor, expel foreigners" faction, on the other hand, took a big blow with the deaths of such important activists as Toshimaro YOSHIDA, Kichima KITAZOE, Teizo MIYABE, Matajiro OTAKA, Junjiro ISHIKAWA, Matsusuke SUGIYAMA and Jusuke MATSUDA. (They were later called the "Seven Martyrs" by the new government.)
Kogoro KATSURA (later Takayoshi KIDO) should have been there too, but he arrived earlier and then went back to the base to wait a while. His life had been spared because the incident occurred before he came back.
Beginning with this incident, the Choshu clan fell under the influence of zealots and later came to Kyoto and raised the Kinmon rebellion on July 19 (in the old calendar).
It has been said that the Ikedaya Incident delayed the Meiji Restoration by a year. There is also another opinion that it sped up the Restoration by stirring up the "revere the emperor, expel foreigners" faction.
Author Ryotaro SHIBA's interpretation is that the Meiji Restoration led by the four major clans of Satsuma, Choshu, Tosa, and Bizen would never have happened without this incident.

Murasaki Shikibu (dates of birth and death unknown) was a female author and poet in the mid-Heian period.
She is well known as the author of "The Tale of Genji."
She is one of the Chuko Sanjurokkasen (medieval 36 Immortal Poets).
Her poem, 'I met a friend after so long, who went back in a hurry before I recognized his face; like the moon goes behind a cloud at a blow' was selected for "Ogura Hyakunin isshu (One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets)."
She was from the Fujiwara clan, and her name as a court lady was 'Fuji Shikibu (Murasaki Shikibu).'
She acquired the sobriquet of 'Murasaki' from the name of the heroine 'Murasaki no Ue' of "The Tale of Genji," and 'Shikibu' refers to her father's position as Shikibutaijo (Aide of Ceremonials).
Murasaki Shikibu's real name is unknown, but it is assumed that she was the 'FUJIWARA no Kaoriko/Takako/Koshi,' who became shoji (ranked) on January 29, 1007, which was described in 'Mido Kanpakuki (FUJIWARA no Michinaga's diary).'
However this view is generally based on the other assumptions, which are said to contain errors in the process of making inferences, so it remains a matter of conjecture.
Also, her dates of birth and death are unknown, but it is suggested that she was about 30 years old in 1008, based on historical materials and her works; by counting backwards from that age, she would have been born around 979 and died around 1016.
Tradition has it that she liked sardines, which was unusual for aristocracy, but this episode is based on a story of Izumi Shikibu in 'Sarugenji no soshi (The Sarugenji Book),' so it seems to have been made up by someone at a later date.
She was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tametoki, governor of Echigo Province, and her mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tamenobu from Settsu Province, but she lost her mother when she was little.
FUJIWARA no Nobunori was her brother by a different father, and apparently she also had an older sister.
FUJIWARA no Sadakata, Sanjo Udaijin (Sanjo minister of the right), and FUJIWARA no Kanesuke, Tsutsumi Chunagon (vice-councilor of state), were her paternal great grandfathers, and she had many relatives who were known as talented writers.
There are many anecdotes stating that, since her childhood, she had had more talent for reading Chinese classics than women were required to have in those days.
It is generally considered that she wrote both "The Tale of Genji," which consists of 54 chapters, and "Murasaki Shikibu Diary," which was about her days in service to the Imperial Court, as well as "Collection of Murasaki Shikibu's Works."
Her father, FUJIWARA no Tametoki, obtained employment as a reader in Togu (the palace of the Crown Prince) while in his thirties, and when the Crown Prince became Emperor Kazan he was promoted to the post of kurodo (Chamberlain) and then to Shikibutaijo; however, when the Emperor became a priest, he lost his job.
Ten years later, as a consequence of dedicating a poem to Emperor Ichijo, he became a governor of Echizen Province.
Murasaki Shikibu, during her childhood, spent two years in the place of her father's assignment.
In about 998, she married a governor of Yamashiro Province FUJIWARA no Nobutaka, who was old enough to be her father; in 999 she bore him a daughter, FUJIWARA no Kataiko/Kenshi, but this marriage life didn't last long because Nobutaka died soon afterward.
In December 29 (according to the lunar calendar) of 1005, she began serving the Empress of Emperor Ichijo FUJIWARA no Shoshi/Akiko (the oldest daughter of FUJIWARA no Michinaga, and later given the name of the Retired Emperor Jotomonin) as a court lady-cum-tutor, and she served the Empress at least until 1011.
There is a poem created by ISE no Taifu, 'Some time ago, double-flowered cherry trees bloomed in the colorful capital of Nara; today they bloom in Kuju Castle in this capital of Kyo, as they did before,' which was collected in "Shika Wakashu (Collection of Poetry)"; the poem was written in dedication to the Empress along with yaezakura (double cherry blossoms) presented to the Imperial Court; however, according to "ISE no Taifu shu (Private Collection)" it was supposed to be a duty of Murasaki Shikibu, but she delegated the duty to a newcomer, Taifu.
The last description about Murasaki Shikibu appears in "Shoyuki," the diary of FUJIWARA no Sanesuke, dated May 25 (lunar calendar) 1014, saying that 'as "a daughter of Tametoki, who was a governor of Echigo Province," she conveyed a message from the wife of the Retired Empress Shoshi to Sanesuke.'
Therefore it is widely believed that she died between 1012 and 1016, in the reign of Emperor Sanjo, but some people disagree.
Also, tradition has it that Murasaki Shikibu's grave can be found at Murasaki no Nishigoshoden-cho (Horikawa Kitaoji Kudaru, West side), Kita Ward, Kyoto City.
Today, the Bank of Japan's D-note of 2,000 yen has a portrait of Murasaki Shikibu and a part of "The Tale of Genji Emaki (picture scroll)" on its back side.
Her name appeared in the great historical figures calendar of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (=UNESCO), and she was the only Japanese to be thus enrolled.
You can read some comments about her contemporary famous court ladies.
Above all, a comment about Sei Shonagon, the author of The Pillow Book, is the most famous (the following is a free translation):
Sei Shonagon is a jerk who acts proudly. Chinese characters, she blots in a wise, have full of mistakes.'("Murasaki Diary" Kurokawabon (type of manuscript))
"Will the life of a person with such insincerity be better in the future?" (from "Murasaki Diary" Kurokawabon)
These comments are quite severe and can be said to be almost backbiting.
These descriptions have been brought into conversation with various conjectures and curiosity (Murasaki Shikibu was jealous of the talent of Sei Shonagon, etc.) up until recently.
However, these two people were distant in age and served the Imperial Court in different times (nearly a decade), so they seem not to have known each other.
She wrote some positive comments about her contemporary female poets, Izumi Shikibu ('her behavior is not good, but her poems are excellent,' etc.), and Akazome-emon.
Emperor Ichijo had a court lady read aloud "The Tale of Genji," at which he praised the author, saying she must have been an eager reader of Nihongi (according to "Shoku-Nihongi (Continuation of Chronicles of Japan)," whereby Nihongi refers to "Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan)"; thus some people claim that "Nihongi" in this context means "Nihonshoki").
Because of this, Murasaki Shikibu was given the nickname 'Nihongi no Otsubone,' but it is widely thought that the Emperor's words brought her into ridicule because it was felt that a woman shouldn't read Chinese classics, and she was distressed by the words.
Murasaki Diary and "Eiga monogatari (A Tale of Flowering Fortunes)," the latter of which has some descriptions common to the Murasaki Diary, states that Michinaga visited her chamber at night.
Additionally, "Various Japanese Family Trees" ("New Compilation of Various Japanese Family Trees Analogy") says that 'a court lady of Jotomonin, a poet, Murasaki Shikibu, an author of The Tale of Genji, or Masatada's granddaughter, Tametoki's daughter, mistress of Michinaga, the chief adviser to the Emperor,' which clearly shows that she was a mistress of Michinaga, but the true relationship between them is unknown.

Academy of Murasaki Shikibu
The purpose of the Academy of Murasaki Shikibu is to promote classical literature as represented by "The Tale of Genji"; the academy was established on June 4, 1932 by Tsukuru FUJIMURA (president), who was the head of the Department of Japanese Literature, Faculty of Letters at Tokyo Imperial University; Senichi HISAMATSU (vice-president), a professor of Japanese literature at Tokyo Imperial University; and Kikan IKEDA (chairperson), a junior assistant of the Japanese literature study room at Tokyo Imperial University.
Since January 1964, the office has been set in Japanese Literature Department lab, School of Literature, Tsurumi University, which is located in Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture.
The current president is Ken AKIYAMA.
The academy holds lecture meetings, supports a play based on "The Tale of Genji" and publishes the following periodicals:
The bulletin "Murasaki" was published every month before World War II (August 1934 - June 1944), and has been published annually after the war era (since 1962).
The collection of academic papers "Studies and Data Traditional Literature Article" has been published by Musashinoshoin annually since June 1969.
Takauji ASHIKAGA (1305-58) was a general from the late Kamakura period to the Northern and Southern Courts period.
He was the 1st Seii Taishogun of the Muromachi Shogunate.
Takauji was a descendant of the Genji clan.
He was the 1st son of Sadauji ASHIKAGA, who was a descendant in the direct line of the Ashikaga clan, which was the powerful family in Kawachi Genji.
In his early years, he was given the name Takauji by the regent Takatoki HOJO.
In 1333, when the Emperor Go-Daigo had raised an army at Mt. Senjosan in Hoki Province, Takauji, the powerful vassal of the Kamakura shogunate, was sent to Kyoto leading the main armies of the shogunate to put down the rebellion, but he switched sides and gathered an army against the shogunate at Shinomura Hachimangu in Tamba Province to capture Rokuhara Tandai.
His achievements were evaluated by Emperor Go-Daigo, and he was awarded the letter (尊), which came from the emperor's real name Takaharu (尊治), so he changed the letter in his name from "高氏" to "尊氏".
While the despotic Kenmu restoration by Emperor Go-Daigo had been losing support, Takauji traveled to the east to suppress the Nakasendai Rebellion, and stayed in Kamakura to try to build his own government.
Because of this, the relationship between Takauji and the imperial court came to an impasse, and he returned to Kyoto, driving the Emperor Go-Daigo out to Mt. Hiei. However, the Emperor's army made a counterattack and Takauji fled to Kyushu temporarily.
He reentered Kyoto and established a new samurai government called the Muromachi Shogunate, being appointed Seii Taishogun by Grand Emperor (Retired Emperor) Kogon and Emperor Komyo.
At the same time, Emperor Go-Daigo moved to Yoshino and set up the Southern Court there.
After he established the Muromachi Shogunate, he and his brother Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA divided power between them, but in later years discord between them increased until the Kanno Disturbance.
The disturbance subsided with the death of Tadayoshi, but even after that Takauji had to keep fighting against his enemies, such as the Southern Court forces, to maintain his government.
After Emperor Go-Daigo died, Takauji built Tenryu-ji Temple to pray for the dead.
Because of his rebellion against the emperor, people had branded him as a traitor since the Meiji era, but after World War II they began to look at him more positively, which illustrates how much the historical point of view affects the way we look at the people in history.
From Birth to the Fall of the Kamakura Shogunate
Takauji was born in 1305.
There are 3 presumptions about his birthplace: Ayabe (Uesugisho in Ayabe City, Kyoto), Kamakura and Ashikagano sho (Ashikaga City, Tochigi Prefecture).
"Nan-Taiheiki" says that when Takauji was given his first bath, two turtledoves flew in; one perched on his shoulder, and the other on the dipper.
His childhood name was Matataro.
On October 10th, 1319, his coming-of-age ceremony (Genpuku) was held at age 15, and he was appointed Jibutaifu of the Fifth Rank, Junior Grade, and given the name Takauji by the regent Takatoki HOJO.
Takauji's father Sadauji and his official wife Shakado, daughter of Akitoki HOJO, had the first son Takayoshi ASHIKAGA, but he died early and Takauji succeeded to his father.
According to "Nan-Taiheiki", Ietoki ASHIKAGA, Takauji's grandfather, killed himself with his sword, praying that the Ashikaga clan may rule over the whole country in 3 generations.
In 1331, Emperor Go-Daigo plotted the overthrow of the shogunate again and raised an army at Kasagi (Genko Incident).
The Kamakura shogunate ordered Takauji, who had been a powerful vassal, to help the shogunate, and he joined the battles at Kasagi where the emperor was based and at Shimoakasaka Castle in which Masashige KUSUNOKI was based.
The incident had taken place just after his father's death, so Takauji at first had refused his help to the shogunate, but the Kamakura shogunate took his wife and children as hostages to make Takauji follow its order.
According to "Koten-Taiheiki," because of this Takauji began to harbor hostility toward the shogunate.
As a result of the attack against the emperor made by the shogunate, the emperor and his followers such as Toshimoto HINO and Enkan were captured, and the following year Emperor Go-Daigo was exiled to Oki Islands (Genko Rebellion).
The shogunate installed Emperor Kogon of the Jimyo-in line as emperor, instead of Emperor Go-Daigo of the Daikaku-ji line.
In the following year, Emperor Go-Daigo escaped from Oki Islands, and raised an army at Mt. Senjosan.
Takauji was ordered to reenter Kyoto with Takaie NAGOE to put down the rebellion in the west.
Takaie was killed by Norimura AKAMATSU, which made Takauji decide to side with the emperor. On April 29th of the same year, he raised an army against the shogunate at Shinomura Hachimangu (present Kameoka City, Kyoto) in Tamba Province.
Takauji gathered forces from various provinces, and entered Kyoto followed by vassals such as Doyo SASAKI from Omi Province, and then succeeded in destroying Rokuhara Tandai on May 7th, 1333.
At about the same time, Yoshisada NITTA, vassal of Kozuke Province, also gathered an army, and destroyed the shogunate, taking Takauji's heir Senjuo (later called Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA), who had escaped from Kamakura, with him.
In this fighting, Takewakamaru, the son of Takauji's concubine, was killed.
After the Kamakura shogunate was crumbled, Takauji ordered Kazuuji HOSOKAWA, Yoriharu HOSOKAWA and Morouji HOSOKAWA to make Yoshisada NITTA return to Kyoto, and let the Ashikaga clan rule Kamakura.
After the fall of the Kamakura shogunate, Emperor Go-Daigo considered Takauji's work to be commendable, and gave him the ranks of Chinjufu Shogun and Sahyoe no Kami with the courtly title of Fourth Rank, Junior Grade, along with 30 plots of land.
In addition to that, he was given the letter (尊), which came from the emperor's given name, and changed the letter of his name Takauji (高氏) into Takauji (尊氏).
Under the Kenmu administration, Takauji left politics and let KO no Moronao, the regent of the Ashikaga clan, and KO no Moroyasu engage in politics, while he made his brother Tadayoshi the regent of the Kamakura Shogunfu.
There are two interpretations of Takauji's behavior; one is that it was Emperor Go-Daigo who made Takauji leave politics, and the other is that it was Takauji who tried to keep away from the government.
There is also a different presumption that Takauji intended to establish the new government in Kamakura.
This condition was called "Takauji's absence in the new government".
While Emperor Go-Daigo appointed Akiie KITABATAKE as Chinjufu Shogun and made him take Prince Noriyoshi (later called Emperor GO-Murakami) to Oshu in order to pacify the place, Takauji made Tadayoshi lead young Prince Narinaga (Nariyoshi) down to Kamakura.
Emperor Go-Daigo's son Prince Morinaga, who also coveted the title of Seii Taishogun, gradually came to rival Takauji, and plotted to assassinate him, but Takauji's security was so tight that he failed to do it.
In 1334, Takauji captured and confined Prince Morinaga, who was in conflict with the emperor too, to Tadayoshi's place in Kamakura, conspiring with the emperor's mistress Yasuko (Kadoko) ANO, who wanted to make her son Prince Tsunenaga (Tsuneyoshi) a crown prince.
In 1335, Nakasendai Rebellion was raised in Shinano Province by the survivors of the HOJO clan, taking Tokiyuki HOJO, bereaved son of Takatoki HOJO, with them, and Tokiyuki's army occupied Kamakura temporarily.
In the rebellion, Tadayoshi killed Prince Morinaga without permission.
Takauji requested that Emperor Go-Daigo appoint him Seii Taishogun only to be rejected, so he marched to Kamakura without emperor's permission on August 2nd of the same year, which made Emperor Go-Daigo reluctantly appoint him as Seito Taishogun.
Tadayoshi's army, joined by Takauji, defeated Tokiyuki HOJO at the Battle of Sagamigawa and regained Kamakura on the 19th of the same month.
Takauji was given the courtly title of the Second Rank.
With Tadayoshi's approval, Takauji established a base in Kamakura and began to allot lands to his followers, ignoring the emperor's command to return to Kyoto, and he tried to establish his own samurai government.
In November, Takauji suggested to the emperor that Yoshisada NITTA was an enemy of the imperial court and should be killed, but on the contrary the emperor ordered Yoshisada to kill Takauji, making Yoshisada take Prince Takanaga (Takayoshi) to Kamakura along Tokaido.
Besides that, Akiie KITABATAKE began to go down to Kyoto from Oshu, so Takauji declared his retirement to get a reprieve. However, once the Ashikaga side, including Tadayoshi and KO no Moronao, began to lose at various provinces such as Mikawa, Takauji decided to revolt against the Kenmu government.
In December of the same year, Takauji defeated Nitta's army at the Battle of Hakone Take no Shita, and advanced his army up to Kyoto.
During that time, Takauji secretly made contact with Emperor Kogon of the Jimyo-in line to justify his entering Kyoto.
In the following month, Takauji reached Kyoto, while Emperor GO-Daigo fled to Mt. Hiei.
Shortly thereafter, Takauji was attacked in Kyoto by the armies of Akiie KITABATAKE, Masashige KUSUNOKI and Yoshisada NITTA from Oshu, and he gave up Kyoto, accepting Enshin AKAMATSU's advice to leave for Kyushu.
On his way down to Kyushu, Yoshinao (Yorihisa) SHONI came to meet him at Akamagaseki, Nagato Province (present Shimonoseki City, Yamaguchi Prefecture), and he was supported by Ujinori MUNAKATA, the chief priest of Munakata Taisha Shrine in Munakata, Chikuzen Province.
In the beginning of March, after visiting Munakata Taisha, Takauji defeated Taketoshi KIKUCHI (Emperor Go-Daigo's side) at the Battle of Tatarahama (present Fukuoka City), and on his way up to Kyoto, he got Emperor Kogon's order and immediately gathered western warriors.
He smashed the armies of Yoshisada NITTA and Masashige KUSUNOKI at the Battle of Minatogawa on April 25th of the same year, and seized Kyoto again in June.
Takauji attempted a reconciliation with Emperor Go-Daigo, who had been at Mt. Hiei, to save face for the emperor.
Emperor Go-Daigo, accepting Takauji's offer, transferred the Imperial Regalia of Japan to Emperor Komyo, a younger brother of Grand Emperor Kogon, and right after that, on November 7th, Takauji declared the opening of a new samurai government, setting the Kenmu Shikimoku in order to show the basic policy of his government to his people.
Emperor Go-Daigo escaped from Kyoto to Yoshino (present Yoshino-cho, Yoshino-gun, Nara Prefecture) taking the Imperial Regalia of Japan with him in December, and announced that the transferred regalia were fake, so he established Yoshino Imperial Court (=Southern Court).
In 1338, Takauji was appointed Seii Taishogun (reigned 1338-58) by Emperor Komyo, which meant that an actual samurai government later called Muromachi Shogunate was established.
In the following year, when Emperor Go-Daigo passed away in Yoshino, Takauji began to found Tenryu-ji temple to pray for the soul of the dead emperor.
In order to raise the funds to build the temple, a trading vessel called Tenryu-ji-bune was set sail for Yuan Dynasty.
Under the new government, Takauji gave Tadayoshi a post as administrative leader and he himself became the leader of the house vassals.
Shin'ichi Sato called such conditions diarchy by Takauji, who held a military power in the lord-and-vassal relationship, and Tadayoshi, who controlled the judicial functions of the regime, in his essay 'Muromachi Bakufu' in "Iawanami Koza Nihon Rekishi vol.7" (Iawanami Publishing, 1963) and explained that the potentiality of the shogun's dual power which had continued since Kamakura Shogunate, came to appear.
The dual power gradually led to a conflict between anti-Tadayoshi group represented by KO no Moronao, and the Tadayoshi group in the government.
This conflict finally raised an internal split called the Kanno Disturbance.
At first Takauji took a neutral stance on it, but he came to side with Moronao's group.
In 1349, Moronao demanded Tadayoshi's retirement from politics, surrounding Takauji's castle in which Tadayoshi had sheltered.
Tadayoshi became a priest and lost his power, but it is said that Moronao and Takauji made an arrangement to exclude Tadayoshi.
While Takauji called back his heir Yoshiakira from Kamakura to put him in charge of political affairs instead of Tadayoshi, he sent his second son Motouji ASHIKAGA to Kamakura in return and set the Kamakurafu to rule the eastern provinces, appointing Motouji Kamakura kubo.
After Tadayoshi's retreat, Takauji's illegitimate son - also Tadayoshi's adopted son - Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA was enlarging his power as a member of the Tadayoshi faction in Kyushu, so Takauji made an expedition to Chugoku District to kill Tadafuyu in 1350.
Then Tadayoshi escaped from Kyoto and sided with the Southern Court, followed by a few of the devoted military commanders such as Tadatsune MOMONOI and Kunikiyo HATAKEYAMA.
When Tadayoshi's army grew stronger, Yoshiakira became powerless and fled from Kyoto. Takauji was also defeated by Tadayoshi's army at Uchidehama in Settsu Province (present Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture).
Takauji sought reconciliation with Tadayoshi on condition that the KO brothers would become priests, and they came to an agreement in 1351.
The KO brothers were assassinated by Yoshinori UESUGI while they were under escort.
Tadayoshi became Yoshiakira's assistant and got involved in political affairs again.
Takauji and Yoshiakira marched to Harima Province on the ostensible purpose to put down the revolt plotted by Doyo SASAKI and Sokuyu (Norisuke) AKAMATSU, but in reality they attempted a reconciliation with the Southern Court, conspiring to kill Tadayoshi and Tadafuyu.
Sensing this conspiracy, Tadayoshi fled to the northern area and reached Kamakura.
In October of the same year, Takauji and the Southern Court reconciled, an event that was called Shohei-itto.
At the same time, Takauji chased Tadayoshi along the Tokaido, and defeated him at the battles of Mt. Satsutamayama in Suruga Province (present-day Shimizu Ward, Shimizu City, Shizuoka Prefecture) and Hayakawajiri in Sagami Province (present-day Odawara City, Kanagawa Prefecture). Takauji captured Tadayoshi and confined him in Kamakura.
Tadayoshi died suddenly in February, 1352.
"Taiheiki" says that Tadayoshi might have been poisoned by Takauji.
Soon after Tadayoshi's death, being attacked by the Southern Court forces represented by Prince Muneyoshi, Yoshioki NITTA, Yoshimune NITTA and Tokiyuki HOJO, Takauji retreated to Musashi Province, but soon returned to Kyoto to defeat the Southern forces.
After that Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA intruded in Kyoto, but eventually he left for Kyushu.
In 1354, Kyoto was retaken by the Southern Court temporarily, but taken back by Takauji the following year.
He plotted to kill Tadafuyu, but died of a tumor on his back at the palace of Made'nokoji in Nijo, Kyoto, on April 30th, 1358.
His age at death: 54.
According to "Baishoron," Takauji regretted having turned against Emperor Go-Daigo, and he for a while he was talking about becoming a priest. In the heat of battle he also talked about killing himself, so Shin'ichi SATO took these descriptions into consideration, and presumed that Takauji might have been a manic depressive.
Takauji's close friend Soseki MUSO described Takauji as a man of virtue in his writing.
Takauji was willing to allot lands to his military commanders, which is considered one of the reasons why he was always supported by them when he was in difficult situations.
It was the Mitogaku originated by Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA that started to consider Takauji as a traitor in the Edo period.
Mitogaku was strongly influenced by Shushigaku Meibunron, and emphasized the validity of the Imperial line.
Because of this, Takauji, who exiled the authentic emperor (Go-Daigo), was described in a negative way as a traitor.
Mitogaku's view of Takauji was inherited by the later generations, and in the late Tokugawa period when Sonno-Joi (Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarian) culminated, the heads of wooden statues of Takauji, Yoshiakira and Yoshimitsu (ASHIKAGA) in Toji-in were pilloried.
After the Meiji period, the Meiji government sought to establish a nation-state which set the emperor in the center of the nation. This produced a nationalistic view of history, which justified Taisei Hokan and Osei Fukko, and so the Taika Reforms, Kenmu no Chuko (=Kenmu restoration) and Meiji Restoration were ranked as the most important reforms.
Until mid Meiji period, source-based study of modern history did not emphasize the validity of Emperor Go-Daigo (the Southern Court), but at around 1907 40 when the Nanbokucho Seijunron arose, the validity of Emperor Go-Daigo came to be stressed, creating a negative evaluation of Takauji.
According to an authorized textbook written before WWII, Takauji was "a traitor who released an arrow against the Emperor", and Kumakichi NAKAJIMA, a member of the Makoto SAITO Cabinet, was forced to retire because he had praised Takauji in his writing.
After WWII, the nationalistic view of history became obsolete, and the source-based study of history made progress on reevaluating Takauji.
Sato's interpretation of Takauji as a ruler in the lord-and-vassal relationship was one example, which afforded an opportunity to develop a study of the samurai government.
In today's historical study, nobody interprets Takauji as a traitor any more, and the process of Takauji's becoming a traitor sometimes can be a theme of historical study.
"Shihon Taiheiki" written by Eiji YOSHIKAWA in the late 1950s had Takauji as a main character, and was accepted by many readers, which suggested that not only the political but also the cultural view of Takauji had shifted very much compared with that before WWII.
"Kibamusha zo" (a portrait of warrior on the horse back), preserved in the Kyoto National Museum, was generally known as a portrait of Takauji, but is now considered to be a portrait of KO no Moronao, the regent of the Ashikaga clan, or that of KO no Moroakira, son of Moronao. It's because there's a decorative signature of the 2nd shogun Yoshiakira on the upper part of the body, and the family crest of the two rings described on the warrior's harness was not the Ashikaga family's, but the KO family's.
Portrait of Taira no Shigemori, one of the Jingo-ji san zo, painted by FUJIWARA no Takanobu in Kamakura period, had been considered a portrait of Shigemori TAIRA, but Michio YONEKURA and Hideo KURODA claimed that it is a portrait of Takauji, and now this interpretation is widely accepted.
Their opinion is based on the comparison of the portrait with the wooden statue of Takauji preserved in Toji-in, and the popular shape of the hatpin, called Kogai, used in the early Muromachi period.
There's another portrait of Takauji preserved in Jodo-ji Temple in Onomichi City, Hiroshima Prefecture.
In addition to that, there are some ukiyoe pictures of Takauji: "Taiheiki Kassenzu," by Yoshitora UTAGAWA; and "Ashikaga Takauji Hyogo Kassenzu," by Chikanobu HASHIMOTO. Both paintings deal with Takauji sheltering in the Jodo-ji Temple in Hyogo Prefecture.
Also some bronze statues of Takauji were made recently; one is placed on the approach to the Bunna-ji Temple in Ashikaga City, and the other is in Ankokuji Town, Ayabe City, Kyoto Prefecture.

Sagano Scenic Railway is the company operating Torokko trams on the Sagano Sight-seeing Tram Line, which utilizes the old San-in Line in Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
Sagano Scenic Railway is a wholly-owned subsidiary of West Japan Railway Company.
The head office is located in Sagatenryuji Kurumamichi-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
To electrify the railway and install multiple tracks, the San-in Line (Sagano Line) between Saga (now Saga-Arashiyama) and Umahori was replaced with a new line in March, 1989, after which the old line along Hozukyo, a famous scenic site, was made into a sight-seeing railway, thereby starting Torokko tram service in 1991.
According to Keitetsu Kyokai's "Unknown Railways" (JTB, 1997), Sagano Scenic Railway is the first railway used purely for sightseeing in Japan.
In front of Saga Torokko Station, which is the start of the Torokko tram on the Kyoto side, there is the 19th CENTURY HALL in which science, technology, and art of the 19th century are on display, and which is also managed by Sagano Scenic Railway.
19th CENTURY HALL displays steam locomotives such as Japanese National Railways Steam Locomotive D51.
History
In November 4, 1990, Sagano Scenic Railway was founded.
On April 27, 1991, Sagano Sight-seeing Tram Line between Saga Torokko Station and Kameoka Torokko Station opened.
Beginning in November, 2002, "Torokky" was used as a poster boy.
In April, 2003, 19th CENTURY HALL opened in front of Saga Torokko Station.
Route
See below for operations.
Sagano Scenic Railway, Sagano Sight-seeing Tram Line - Saga Torokko Station to Kameoka Torokko Station: 7.3km

One Kyoto City bus appeared in a local campaign film during the 2007 fiscal year, which was produced by the Japan Ad Council with a message saying, "It runs on waste tempura oil."
The commercial film says that bio-diesel fuel made from waste vegetable oil is used for city buses and garbage trucks as a substitute for light oil in their activities, as a means for the prevention of global warming as advocated by the Kyoto Protocol of 1997.
This commercial film, produced by the Japan Ad Council's Osaka Bureau, aired mainly on Kansai local TV (partially nationwide).
The Seimei-jinja Shrine is a Shinto shrine in Kamigyo Ward of Kyoto City.
It's dedicated to Seimei ABE.
It's located at the site of his premises, which once existed near (northwest of) the Ichijo Modori-bashi.
There are many shrines nationwide with the same name.
When Seimei died in 1005, Ichijyo, the Emperor of the time, admired his work and called him the reincarnation of Inari the god. A shrine was built and dedicated to him at the site of his premises in 1007.
The area of the shrine was large at first but gradually diminished through events like wars and the urban improvement by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and its buildings were left decayed.
From the last days of the Tugawa shogunate, the shrine's buildings and precincts were repaired by funds raised mainly by the shrine parishioners. In 1950, the shrine's area was changed to face Horikawa street.
During the Heisei era, Seimei ABE became extremely popular and worshipers have come to visit the shrine from all over the country.
The millennium commemoration for Seimei ABE was held in 2005, when a thousand years had passed since his death.

University
Ryuku University originated from "Gakuryo", an educational facility, set up by Nishi Hongan-ji Temple in A.D.1639, and has a long history of an university under the old system based on the Imperial Order of University.
As an university, it has 8 faculties and about 20,000 students.
Spirit of foundation
"Seeking for Truth, Living in Truth, and Revealing Truth"
Additionally, Ryukoku University put forward 5 objectives, "Equality","Independence","Introspection","Gratitude", and "Peace", as the plain summary of the spirit of the foundation, which is based on the Jodo Shinshu teachings.
Since the university started in the form of "Gakuryo"and then "Gakurin" in the Edo period, it has accumulated academic acievements and historical materials about Buddhism and has produced many religious scholars and famous Buddhist priests.
Some students of the General School had voluntarily launched the "Hanseikai Magazine" as a journal for a social reform campaign in A.D.1887, and this magazine was retitled "Chuokoron"in A.D.1899 and has been developed as a general interest magazine until today.
Omiya Library has a lot of collections that Otani Expedition Party brought back from the Silk Road, the ancient trade road in Central Asia, and also has many precious books from inside and outside of Japan, including those granted by Nishi Hongan-ji Temple and designated as national treasures and important cultural assets.
"Nagao Library and Collections"in Fukakusa Library owns more than 70% of the records of Japanese companies' history, issued from the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate to 1985, and it has now about 16,800 pieces of materials including the added collections.
They are valuable reseach stuff for Faculty of Economics and Business Administration.
"Ryukoku Extension Center (REC)", the center of collaboration among enterprises, the government & municipal offices, research agencies, and others, engages in various activities, such as getting patents on the achievements of reseach and holding seminors for the general public.
(For details, please refer to the heading of Ryukoku Extension Center.)
Five buildings of the university, including Central, North, and South Hall of Omiya Campus, are designated as the national important cultural assets because of their modern style of architecture in the Meiji era.
In 2005, Ryukoku University got "AA-(double A minus)"(ranking 4 among 21 schools) from Rating & Investment Information,Inc.(R&I) for the financial index of the university corporation and has kept the same rank continuously for three years up to 2007.
The school color is purple.
In A.D.1639, it was founded as Gakuryo of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.
In A.D.1650, Seijo (school rules) of Gakuryo was established.
In A.D.1655, Gakuryo was ordered to dissolve by the Tokugawa shogunate because of the dispute in Syo'o over the Jodo Shinshu teachings.
And Gakuryo was renamed Gakurin.
In A.D.1788, Gakurin burned down in the big fire that broke out in Kyoto City.
In A.D.1792, the Hall of Gakurin was rebuilt.
In A.D.1867, the reform of Gakurin started.
In A.D.1869, the course of Hajagaku (Christianity) was started.
In A.D.1871, the site of Gakurin was transferred to Shichijyo-dori Omiya in Shimogyo Ward.
And the courses of Naigaku (study of the Buddhism), Kogaku (native studies), and Kangaku (Chinese studies) were started.
In A.D.1872, the Western learning of "the German language course"was started.
In A.D.1875, the European system of school was adopted.
And the course of Futugaku (the general subject) was started.
In A.D.1876, Gakurin was renamed Daikyoko.
In A.D.1879, some buildings in Omiya campus were completed, such as Central, South and North Hall, and Main Gate, which are all still in use, and Former Station of Custodian.
In A.D.1880, the Emperor Meiji visited Daikyoko.
In A.D.1887, some students in the General School voluntarily launched the "Hanseikai Magazine"(the precedent of "Chuokoron" today).
In A.D.1888, Daikyoko was renamed Daigakurin.
In A.D.1900, Daigakurin was renamed Bukkyo Daigaku (Buddhist University).
In A.D.1902, Bukkyo Daigaku was divided into two, one was Bukkyo Senmon Daigaku (Buddhist Special University) in Kyoto and the other was Takanawa Bukkyo Daigaku (Takanawa Buddhist University) in Tokyo.
In A.D.1904, Takanawa Bukkyo Daigaku was closed and integrated with Bukkyo Senmon Daigaku.
In A.D.1905, Bukkyo Daigaku was approved by the Imperial Order of Vocational College.
In A.D.1922, Bukkyo Daigaku was approved as the university (under the old system) by the Imperial Order of University and was retitled Ryukoku University.

The 22 Shrines are part of the Shakaku for Shinto shrines.
They were established from the middle to late Heian period.
These shrines receive special offerings from the Imperial Court.
They are mostly chosen from shrines in the Kinai area.
Establishment of the 22 Shrines
Under the Ritsuryo system, offerings were given by the Imperial court for Kinen-sai and other festivals to many shrines listed in the Engi-shiki Jimmyo-cho; but that number has been reduced to a special few shrines after the decline of the Ritsuryo system.
That number and the shrines in it changed many times and came to include some newly established shrines, before being finalized as the following 22 Shrines in 1081.
Although the movement at the end of the Heian period to include Itsukushima Shrine was not successful, that shrine received offerings from the imperial court until the latter part of the Muromachi period, and even in the Edo period in the event of disasters.
22 Shrines Summary
Upper 7 Shrines
Middle 7 Shrines

The original meaning was a teacher who regularly gave instruction to a priest who has been ordained and entered the priesthood.
In "Jujuritsu" it indicates the ordaining master.
In Japan the title of Daiosho (Great Osho) was given to Ganjin, who came over to teach the precepts in 758, and later was used as a title of respect for high level priests, and eventually for those at the level of chief priest and above.
The manner of writing and pronunciation varies by sect, and in some regions the word is even shortened to 'Ossan' or 'Ossama' (with the accent in the beginning).
Wajo: Ritsu sect, Jodo Shin sect (only for a master of ceremonies)
Wajo: Hoso sect, Shingon sect, etc.
Kasho: Kegon sect, Tendai sect, etc.
Osho: Zen sects, Jodo sect, etc.
