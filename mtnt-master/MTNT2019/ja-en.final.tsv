629	81	維新はただの自民親衛隊だから(対決法案でほとんど与党案に賛成)置いておいて、国民民主と自由(小沢)は非自民中道を目指しているという点で共通点があると思う	Japan Innovation Party is just LDP groupies (during controversial legislation they are usually behind the ruling party) so it doesn't matter much, the Democratic Party For the People and Liberal Party (Ozawa) are similar on the point that they are aiming the middle course of anti-LDP
630	81	ただ小沢については過去のキャリアがあって好きな人嫌いな人がいて、玉木という新しい政治家のイメージとは違うから有権者にどう見られるかだよね	People either love or hate Ozawa because of his past records, and his image is different from the newcomer politician Tamaki, so this will depend on how the voters see him
631	81	党の知名度不足を補いたいという玉木の狙いはわかるけれど 一般国民としては自民党が好きなら自民党に、自民党が嫌いなら野党第一党(立憲民主党)に投票していればいいんじゃないの	I understand the intention of Tamaki who wants to compensate for the lack of visibility of his party, but as a citizen,  I bet it makes more sense to just vote for LDP if you like them, or vote for the biggest opposition party (The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan) if you don't

Is there a rule that only idiots worse than dumb animals can stay in Kasumigaseki?

660	1281	低品質ゲームの取り締まりなんて、不可能だしするべきじゃない	Managing low quality games sounds impossible and they shouldn’t do that
661	1281	そうじゃなくて、そういうものが市場原理によって淘汰される地盤のしっかりした仕組みを模索すべきでしょう	Rather, they should search for a solution with a solid foundation where the market dynamics would curtail them
662	1281	儲からなければ作らないわけですから、そういうのは  なぜそういうゲームが儲かってしまっているのか、そこに着目すべきでしょ。	They won't manufacture them if they are not going to make money so we should pay attention on why those games sell in the first place.

681	1547	今はもうおま国になってるけど最初はSteamから直接買えたのか	It’s GEO blocked now, so I guess you could initially buy it directly from Steam
682	1547	おま値はまだわかるけど最初おま値で売る気見せてたのに即日おま国ってやってることめちゃくちゃすぎて意味わからんな	I get the GEO pricing, but pretending to sell at GEO pricing and then GEO blocking on the same day doesn't make sense
683	1547	セガ新作はデフォ設定がおま値で、最初からおま国にする予定だったのがし忘れてたとかかな	Maybe SEGA has default GEO pricing for new releases and planned GEO blocking this to start with but just forgot
684	1547	まあ今んところキーには規制かかってないぽいから買えるところで買えばアクチはできそう（HumbleとかFanaticalでは買えない）	Seems the keys aren't blocked so it looks like you can activate it if you get to buy it somewhere (can't buy it at Humble or Fanatical)

700	1117	翻訳の機能はたぶんgoogleのやつだし、改行位置や改行の数で精度が変わるのは避けられないと思う	The translation function is probably taken from Google, and we cannot avoid accuracy changes depending on the places and numbers of returns
701	1117	面倒だけどセンテンスで改行2つ以上入れて再翻訳ならそこまで酷くならないかも	It would be a little more work but if you return more than twice in a sentence and re-translate, it might not be so bad

728	1400	その頃は新旧問わず大半が良作で、そうでなくても名前くらいは聞いたことある作品ばかりだったから、ゲームの数が多いとそれだけで、「すげー」「うらやましー」だった	Back then, most of them were of good quality regardless of old or new, and even those that weren't people knew of the names, so just having a lot of games elicited peoples' "awesome" "jealous" comment.
729	1400	セールが来たら有名なのはもちろん、安いのから興味のないのも貪るように買ってた	When they had the sale I greedily bought all the cheap ones and even ones I wasn't interested in, not to mention famous ones.
730	1400	けど今は、数は多くてもゴミばかりだからゲームの所持数が増えても虚しいだけになった	But now, there are a lot of trash even though there are many titles and just increasing the amount of games owned leaves me feeling empty.
731	1400	それからは欲しいゲームだけ買うようになった	After that I started to buy just the ones I want
732	738	タバコも同様酒も同様リスカも同様やと思うけど区別つけようがないから一緒くたにするしかないんちゃうん	I think the same thing can be said for cigarettes, liquor and wrist cuts and as we can't really differentiate we should treat them all the same

745	1005	下で単に物事はあるものであると思うと病むって言ってるけど、私はそう思うと楽だと思うな〜	somebody’s saying below that we get sick fi we think that things happen because they happen, but for me, it's much easier to think that way
746	1005	何か超越的存在によってjudgeされることもないわけじゃーん	Because I’m not going to be judged by something transcendental in its existence
747	1005	うーんなんていうかね何をしてもそれが意味を持つというのはその行為の情報が行き渡る範囲の個々の意識における主観に過ぎないみたいな？	So, how should I put this, saying something has meaning is just a subjective point of view regarding the information of that action within the reach of each individual consciousness
748	1005	そしてその中でも自己以外には好きに思わせておけばいいし   適度に常時解離してるみたいな感じかな？	Others can think what they want to think and I guess there is a moderate level of constant disconnect you know?

765	10048	何で許可権者の県が検査させろって言ってるのに、勝手にその必要はないって言えるんだよ？	The prefecture which has the right to provide a permit is asking to let them investigate, why would they selfishly say that is not necessary?

I do not know the contents of this game well, but I thought the issue was selling it as is to countries where mosaic (regulation) is required   turns out it was the other reason

1084	2376	#	#
1085	2050	私のようなインディ開発者は、物陰に潜んだ威勢だけはいい負け犬のようなものです。	Indie devs like myself are the scrappy underdogs that hide in the shadows.
1086	2050	AAAゲーム会社は200ドルのコレクターズエディションのバッグにナイロンを使用して数ドルをケチったり、ゲームをよりよくするために（敵対的なフィードバックに向き合いつつ）ルートボックスを改良したりしていますが、我々インディ開発者はハート©でゲームを作っています。	The AAA game company saves a few bucks by using nylon for the bags of their collector's edition and revamp loot boxes  (all the while dealing with negative feedback) to make the game better, while the rest of us indie devs make games from the ©Heart.
1087	2050	裏に冷徹で打算的な動きがないというわけではありませんが、ほとんどのインディはプレイステーションストアやSteam、あるいは思いついたものどこでもいいのですが、消費者に販売するためにまったく同じ配信構造を利用していながら、巨大で動きの悪いゲーム産業においては全くの蚊帳の外に置かれています。	It doesn't mean there isn't any cold and calculating move behind the scenes, but most indie developers use PlayStation Store, Steam, or whatever they come up with to sell to consumers using the exact same distribution structure, while we exist outside the huge, slow-moving game industry.
1088	2050	だから我々ゲームファンはCall of Dutyが年末に過去最高収益を上げた、Xbox Game Passが100万人の加入者を獲得したといった話にはうなずき、新鋭のインディ開発者がSwitch移植で最高収益を上げた、アーリーアクセスから新たな大ヒットが生まれたといった話には心温まり、興奮すら覚えるのです。	So, game fans like us nod our collective heads when we hear that Call of Duty had the highest earnings ever at the end of the year or that Xbox Game Pass captured a million subscribers, and feel the warmth or even excitement when we hear the latest Indie developer made his highest earnings with their Switch port, or a new monster hit item emerging out of Early Access.
1089	2050	特に一つの企業として生き残ることがこれほど困難な時代に、インディが勝つと本当に気分がよくなります。	It feels good when indies win, especially at a time where its never been more difficult to survive as a corporation.
1090	2050	Fortniteで大きな収入を獲得したEpicが、独自のPCゲームランチャーストアを発表したのは、そうした温かさを取り繕ったものかもしれません。	Perhaps it was under that guise of warm, cuddly feelings that Epic, flush with cash from Fortnite, announced their own PC game launcher store.
1091	2050	開発者への提案は単純です：70%ではなく88%の稼ぎ、厳選されたストアの完備、潜在的には現在PC第二位となる加入者へのアクセス。	The proposal to the developer is simple: earning 88% instead of 70%, complete with a curated store and access to the potentially second biggest audience on PC right now.
1092	2050	これは、Steamで高収益を上げた開発者には優遇措置を提供するという、インディ開発者の大多数を無視したSteamのニュースに端を発し、大きな拡散が起こりえる下地となりました。	This, coming off the news of Steam offering financial breaks to the highest earners of Steam, all but ignoring a majority of indie devs, was primed to make the biggest splash possible.
1093	2050	ゲームアワードでEpic独占として発表された一連のゲームとともに、その見出しには事実上こう書かれています：競争がないことに満足しつつ成長を続けるSteamに、突如としてインディ開発者がより多くの金を稼げる新たなライバルが現れた。	With the series of games announced as Epic exclusives at the Game Awards, the headlines were written as such: Steam, growing complacent with the lack of competition, suddenly has a new rival that makes more money for indie devs.
1094	2050	すべての勤勉なインディ、ビジネス的によい方法で生まれる他社との競争の精神、そしてあらゆる場所のゲーマーにとってwin-winである。	It’s a win-win for all the diligent indies, for the spirit of competition to make others react in business-friendly ways, and for gamers everywhere.
1095	2050	Epic Storeが開店して各ストアの力学について学んだ結果、私は以下の結論に達しました。	As the launch of the Epic store unfolds and I’ve learned more about the dynamics of each store, I have come to the following conclusion:
1096	2050	顧客のためでもなければ競争のためでもなく、インディ開発者のためでもない。	Not for customers, nor for the competition, nor for indie developers.
1097	2050	##### パーセンテージ  開発者として、あなたがSteamでの売り上げを減らすか、Epicでの売り上げを増やすか、という決断を下したときの話に戻ります。	##### Percentages    Let’s go back to that moment when, as a dev, you had to make the decision of either earn less per sale on Steam, or earn more on Epic.
1098	2050	もちろん、ほかにも考慮すべき点はいくつもありますが：あなたはEpic Storeの立ち上げによって、PCで二番目に大きくなる可能性のあるストアの最前線に立つチャンスが得られます。	Of course, there are also a number of other things to consider: With the launch of Epic Store, you have the opportunity to be at the forefront of ¥what could be the second biggest store on PC.
1099	2050	Epic広告装置の一部となって、あなたのゲームはトレーラーが流れ、スプラッシュに使われます。	You get to be a part of the Epic PR machine, trotting out trailers of your game and using it in their marketing splashes.
1100	2050	成功という面において、Steamはもはやなんの保証もありません――特に、Valveのプロモーション対象となれない場合は、あなたのゲームはアルゴリズムの海で永遠に失われてしまうかもしれないのです。	In terms of success, Steam no longer has any guarantees - especially if you don't get promotional coverage by Valve, your game may be lost forever in the sea of algorithms.
1101	2050	私が言いたいのは、時限独占契約と引き換えにEpicと同時出発する機会が与えられれば、断るのは難しい提案だろうということです。	What I would like to say is that it would be a difficult proposition to decline if given the opportunity to launch with Epic in exchange for an exclusivity for a period of time.
1102	2050	収益の30%カットを選ぶか、顧客を犠牲にしてでもPR効果を追加して収益の12%カットを選ぶか？	Take the 30% revenue cut, or the 12% revenue cut with added PR benefits at the expense of the customer?
1103	2050	：この決定がもたらすものこそ、ほとんどのインディ開発者が今まで経験したことのなかった非常に厳しく冷淡なAAAビジネスの決定なのでしょう。	: What this decision comes down to is the very tough and cold AAA business decision that most indie devs have never experienced before.
1104	2050	開発者にとってEpic Storeがいかに素晴らしいかというこの惜しみない広報は、顧客にとっては間違いなく純損失です。	With all this publicity about how great the Epic Store is for developers, it is definitely a net loss for customers.
1105	2050	あなたのゲームによって体験を悪化させられてしまうのです。	They are getting a worse experience with your game.
1106	2050	##### Epicランチャー  Steam15年来の機能に見合った答えをEpicが開店初日に出すという期待はしていませんでした。	###### Epic’s Launcher   I didn't expect Epic to have an answer on the first day of its store that met Steam's 15 year feature set.
1107	2050	それ以上のものを期待していたのです。	I was expecting more than that.
1108	2050	単なる別のランチャーとしてEpic Storeでのゲーム購入を拒否することはたやすいのです。	It's easy to dismiss buying games on the Epic Store as just another launcher.
1109	2050	それは顧客が自分の好きなPCのストアで楽しんできたものをすべて脇へ追いやることになりますから。	It is side stepping everything that a customer has enjoyed from their own preferred stores on PC.
1110	2050	ほかのストアプラットフォームで利用できるユーザー機能をいくつか見てみましょう：  *Humble Store*   DRMフリーパッケージ(オプション)、Android版ゲーム(APK)へのアクセス、Steamキー、チャリティ協賛のサポート、他人へのギフト購入、返金(ケースバイケース)、ウィッシュリスト。	Let's take a look at some of the user features available on other store platforms: * Humble Store * DRM-free packages (optional), access to Android versions of games (APK), Steam keys, Charity-share support, gift purchases for others, refunds (case by case basis), wish lists.
1111	2050	*GOG.com*   DRMフリーパッケージ、実績付きGOG Galaxyクライアント、リーダーボード、フレンドリスト、フォーラム、クラウドセーブ、ロールバックブランチ、マルチプレイヤーAPI、Steamとのクロスプレイ、ゲームレビュー、ウィッシュリスト、以前購入したゲームへのSteamキー提供(ゲームごとに異なる特別なプロモーション)、返金。	* GOG.com *  DRM-free packages, access to the GOG Galaxy client with Achievements, Leaderboards, Friends List, forums, cloud saves, roll back branches, multiplayer API, cross play with Steam, game reviews, wish lists, Steam keys for older purchases (via special promotions that vary from game to game), refunds.
